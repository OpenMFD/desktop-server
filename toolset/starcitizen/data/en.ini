assassin_danger_0001=If even half the rumors about them are true, you're going to want to take them out long before they see you coming. 
assassin_danger_0002=Apparantly, this is supposed to be one of the more dangerous hitters in the sector. Do not make the mistake of underestimating them. 
assassin_danger_0003=Make sure to bring your full arsenal when you go hunting. Something tells me you might need it to take them down. 
assassin_danger_0004=Word of warning, no way someone like ~mission(TargetName|Last) is going down easy. You want to take them out? Do it hard and fast. 
assassin_desc=~mission(Description)
assassin_desc_0001=Looking for someone who doesn't mind getting their hands dirty. Not talking guild work or anything, just someone who's good enough to aim and squeeze. See, ~mission(Client) want ~mission(TargetName) permanently gone. Start looking at ~mission(Location). ~mission(MultiPlayer)~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)
assassin_desc_0002=The ~mission(Client) got a mess that needs cleaning up. Paying solid credits for it too. The mess goes by the name of ~mission(TargetName). ~mission(Danger)Buddy of mine saw them around ~mission(Location), but the rest is up to you. ~mission(MultiPlayer)~mission(Timed)
assassin_desc_0003=There's a price on ~mission(TargetName)'s head. ~mission(MultiPlayer)Credits go to whoever bags the bastard first. ~mission(Timed)I'd recommend starting at ~mission(Location) but hey, don't let me tell you how to do your job. ~mission(Danger)
assassin_desc_0004=Guess who just got themselves placed onto the ~mission(Client)' no-breathe-list? Some dragger named ~mission(TargetName). Yeah, I never heard of them either, but better them than us, right? ~mission(Danger)~mission(MultiPlayer)Word is they've been haunting ~mission(Location) lately, so you'll probably want to start there. ~mission(Timed)Good luck.
assassin_desc_0005=I don't know what ~mission(TargetName) did, but they sure pissed off the wrong people. Credits go to whoever can give them a last lesson in manners straight through the head. ~mission(Danger)There isn't much to go on, just some scattered sightings around ~mission(Location), so maybe start there. ~mission(Timed)~mission(MultiPlayer)One last thing, the client wants you to say '~mission(Phrase).' when the trigger's pulled. Don't ask. Just do it. 
assassin_desc_0006=~mission(TargetName) is breathing borrowed air. Time's come to punch their ticket for good. ~mission(Timed)I can give you ~mission(Location) but you have to provide your own transport and clean weapons. ~mission(Danger)~mission(MultiPlayer)
assassin_desc_0007=You know how they say the good die young? It's definitely true in this case. ~mission(Client) put a hit out on ~mission(TargetName), a local security thug that's hellbent on being a hero. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)~mission(MultiPlayer)
assassin_desc_0008=Why don't these security assholes ever learn to mind their own damn business? It's like they want to get murdered. Especially this one. Name's ~mission(TargetName). Been stirring up huge trouble for the ~mission(Client) lately, but you're gonna put a permanent end to that. ~mission(Timed)~mission(MultiPlayer)~mission(Danger)Knowing these security types, don't be surprised if they call for back up.
assassin_desc_0009=About time someone put ~mission(TargetName) in their place. This security hackjob's been taking bribes to look the other way, but the greedy little idiot decided to raise the rates. Big mistake! Now instead of those credits going to pay the smug bastard off, they're being used to pay you to murder their ass. That's some poetic justice right there. ~mission(Danger)~mission(MultiPlayer)~mission(Timed)
assassin_desc_0010=This bounty hunter by the name of ~mission(TargetName) made the mistake of messing with one of the ~mission(Client)'s crew. They're looking to even the score and are offering pretty decent creds to whoever does the deed. ~mission(Danger)~mission(MultiPlayer)~mission(Timed)
assassin_desc_0011=I love it. This is one of those classic 'the hunter has become the hunted' scenarios you always see on the spec. ~mission(Client) have put a big bounty out on the head of bounty hunter ~mission(TargetName). ~mission(Danger)It'll be interesting to see how they like it when they tables are turned. ~mission(MultiPlayer)~mission(Timed)
assassin_desc_first=Listen, I know you don't know me, but that's kinda the point of this little experiment. We're just two complete strangers helping each other out. \n\nHere's how this works - I give you a name. ~mission(TargetName), for example. Then I'll tell you a place: ~mission(Location). Now, if by some complete and utter coincidence, they wind up shot to death a little while later, a bunch of credits will mystically appear in your account. Long story short, ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst) has some bad luck, you have some good luck. Everybody's happy.\n\nOf course, there are plenty of other people eager for the help of a dependable stranger and if you do a good job here, I'll make sure they know you're the stranger to talk to.\n\nGood luck out there.

confirmkill_desc_0002=I keep telling people you gotta vet before you hire, but do they listen? Course not. Take the ~mission(Client) for example. They paid some alleyscag to off ~mission(TargetName), but now they're worried the job might not actually be done and they want someone to go out to ~mission(Location) and verify the hit. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)Interested?
confirmkill_desc_0003=Another job of mine was supposed to be all wrapped up, but now the ~mission(Client) are worried that ~mission(TargetName) might still be upright.

confirmkill_desc_0004=Not sure if you heard yet, apparently ~mission(TargetName) is dead. Like dead, dead. Everyone is scrambling to find out if it's true or not, but I got a lead on where the body might be. ~mission(Timed)Head to ~mission(Location) and confirm for me, I'll make sure it's worth your while. ~mission(Danger)
confirmkill_desc_0005=The ~mission(Client) paid big credits to have this problem of theirs permanently solved, but I guess the proof of death didn't come through. Sucks for them, but works out for me and you. I can't go myself, but I can give you the location of ~mission(Location). Go and confirm that ~mission(TargetName) is toe up. ~mission(Danger)Simple enough job, don't even have to kill anyone yourself, and the credits are right. ~mission(Timed)
confirmkill_desc_0006=Hope you don't mind corpses, cause I need you to get up close and personal with one. Used to go by the name ~mission(TargetName). You should find what's left of them at ~mission(Location) and hopefully confirm that the bastard's really dead. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)Anything else you find when you're out there is fair game.
confirmkill_desc_0007=Got word that ~mission(TargetName) might be dead. 'Might' ain't gonna cut it with me, so I want you to go to ~mission(Location) and make sure of it.~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)If you have any other questions, just figure it out yourself. That's what I pay you for.

Covalex_Danger_001=One more thing, I'm seeing here that you'll be working in a heightened safety area. I'm sure you always follow best practices, but a little extra caution probably wouldn't be a bad idea. Better safe than sorry, right! 
Covalex_Danger_002=One last thing, it looks like some of our previous operators have reported outlaw activity in the area. Might be a good idea to plan for some extra security precautions. But if you do get into a situation (though you probably won't!), remember Covalex's policy of 'Flight, not fight.' 
Covalex_Danger_003=Also, unfortunately, it seems a security flag has been placed on this contract. Nothing to worry about too much... but that said, you should probably at least be extra careful during this job. Be ready for anything and you'll never be surprised! 
Covalex_Danger_004=One more little wrinkle. The system has flagged this contract as potentially hazardous. It might not mean anything, but don't be too surprised if you run into a bump or two or three while completing this one. 
Covalex_Danger_005=Last thing. This contract has been given a security flag. They add those when there is a higher risk involved. Sometimes it's hazardous routes, sometimes outlaw sightings, but you're going to want to be extra sharp on this one.

Covalex_Reaction_Bad_001=Hate to do this, but wanted to check in about that last contract. Seems like you had some problems. Now, while we all run into unavoidable obstacles from time to time, I'm going to encourage you to take a moment to think about what went wrong and three things that you can improve upon for your next contract. It's a little exercise that always helps me improve my performance, and isn't that what life is about? Self improvement? All right, back to the exciting new business at hand! 
Covalex_Reaction_Bad_002=To get a bit of business out of the way, I briefly wanted to mention your performance on the last contract. I have in my notes that it was less than satisfactory. Probably just an off day, and I sure know about those, but I would like to strongly encourage you to use this contract as an opportunity to show us just how good you really are. 
Covalex_Reaction_BadStreak_001=You haven't been having much luck out there have you? I don't want to get too overly dramatic, but your performance stats over the last few contracts have been falling well below average. However, your luck hasn't completely run out! Covalex believes firmly in cultivating talent and allowing people to learn from our mistakes ( Thankfully! I probably wouldn't be here otherwise :p ). So, let's put all that behind us as a learning experience and meet the future head on! 
Covalex_Reaction_BadStreak_002=This is part of my job that I do not look forward to. We have to talk about your recent string of contracts. Things have just not been going your way have they? I'm not gonna sugar coat it, your performance stats are not look so hot. But you know what they say, nothing makes up for the past like the present. Let's get you back out there, and see what you can really do. 
Covalex_Reaction_BadToGood_001=Got to say, you really turned it around with that last job! Awesome work! Now, let's just keep it up! 
Covalex_Reaction_BadToGood_002=Congrats on the flipping your performance status around! I was rooting for you, and sure enough, you really proved on that last job that when push comes to shove, you can get it done. Now we just got to keep that momentum going! 
Covalex_Reaction_Good_001=My records show that you did a great job with that last contract! I personally wanted to say well done. It's that kind of performance that Covalex really loves to see. 
Covalex_Reaction_Good_002=Wanted to take a second to say that you did a stellar job with that last contract and that your hard work is not going unnoticed! 
Covalex_Reaction_GoodStreak_001=I was looking back through my records and wow! You've been doing a fantastic job recently. I've talked about you to some of the other Jr. Logistics Operators, and you didn't hear it from me, but they're pretty jealous I'm working with such a stellar contractor. Keep this up and we'll both be Covalex stars! 
Covalex_Reaction_GoodStreak_002=First off, I want to let you know how much I, and everyone here at Covalex Shipping, really appreciate the hard work you've been putting in. You've consistently have been completing contracts above and beyond my expectations. Alright, that's probably enough stroking your ego! 
Covalex_Reaction_GoodToBad_001=I'm going to confess, I was a little surprised seeing that report come in from your last contract. You had been doing so well! For now, let's just call it a fluke and focus on the next job, okay? 
Covalex_Reaction_GoodToBad_002=I have to ask - were you as disappointed about that last contract as I was? You had such a good record going! But don't worry. Everyone makes mistakes. It's what we do with those mistakes that matter. It's like that saying - "I'd rather try and fail, than fail to try." 
Covalex_Reaction_LastWarning_001=So, with your recent performance issues, I'm afraid that if you don't turn things around, Covalex will be putting you on a probationary disciplinary period and remove you from active contractor status. But don't worry, this contract is you're chance show us how dedicated you are to meeting Covalex Shipping's high standards. I'm sure you'll do great. 
Covalex_Reaction_LastWarning_002=There's a bit of bad news. I've received notice that your time with Covalex may be transitioning to a less 'active' role. Seems that your track record hasn't been all that satisfactory. Good news is that it's not too late for you to change people's minds! You knock this next contract into the goal, and it'll show you still have some tricks up your sleeves. 
Covalex_Reaction_Renew_001=I know it's been a little while since we last spoke, but I'm happy to report that my manager has agreed to allow you to do another 'Evaluation Trial' to regain active status as a Covalex Independent Contractor. I'm a firm believer in giving people another chance to prove themselves, and this is yours! 
Covalex_Reaction_Renew_002=I've got some good news. We were directed to go through our probationary contractors list and see if there were candidates who we felt deserved to be reconsidered. You immediately came to mind! What do you say? You ready to wipe the slate clean and give it another try? 
Covalex_SignOff_001=Thanks in advance for ensuring prompt service,
Covalex_SignOff_002=Good luck out there!
Covalex_SignOff_003=Talk to you soon,
Covalex_SignOff_004=And as the poster on my wall says, 'Bee Safe, Honey!'
Covalex_SignOff_005=Can't wait to hear how everything goes,
Covalex_SignOff_006=Have a good one,
Covalex_SignOff_007=Happy travels and fly safe!
Covalex_SignOff_008=I'm rooting for you. Make me proud!
Covalex_Timed_001=The order has been flagged as a 'Rush Priority' job, so you will be expected to complete the contract within the designated window. Hope that won't be a problem. 
Covalex_Timed_002=There is a tight deadline on this contract, so be sure to keep an eye on the clock. 
Covalex_Timed_003=Plus, we need everything wrapped up by a specific deadline. Got to keep the customers happy! 
Covalex_Timed_004=This will be a 'Rush Priority' job. That means that we can't afford any delays. 
Covalex_Timed_005=The customer requested 'Rush Priority' so you will have to keep a close eye on the time while you're working.

covalexrand_desc_0001=Been waiting forever for Covalex to get their act together after the accident they had, but I just don't think it's going to happen at this point. Hoping you could go out to Gundo and grab my order for me. ~mission(Reference)~mission(Timed)I don't need you to take it all the way to me either. I arranged for shipment from ~mission(Destination) so all you'd have to do is leave it there at the front desk for me.\n\nThanks,\n~mission(TargetName)
covalexrand_desc_0002=I had an important shipment with Covalex and apparently it was waiting at Gundo when they had that big accident there. They said the delivery was going to be delayed, but it's been months now and they're still telling me the same exact thing. No new information or anything. I'm losing a ton of money on this and the best they can offer me is an apology. Not good enough. Figure if they can't finish the delivery, I'll find someone who can. ~mission(Reference)Need it delivered to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)
covalexrand_desc_0003=Hey, a gift I ordered is stuck out on that Covalex station that exploded or whatever and now they say they can't deliver it. I'm really sorry about what happened there, but I already missed our anniversary and if I miss their birthday too, I'm gonna be dead. Basically, I need that box to be at ~mission(Destination) by any means necessary. ~mission(Reference)~mission(Timed) 
covalexrand_desc_0004=Look, we can all agree it was a real tragedy what happened out there at Gundo, and I'm sorry people lost their lives, but that doesn't mean I don't need my package delivered, right? And if Covalex isn't willing or able to do it, then I have every right to go and get delivered on my own. That only seems fair. ~mission(Reference)If you're interested, I'll need it taken to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)\n\nGood luck,\n~mission(TargetName)
covalexrand_desc_0005=I'm in a bit of a bind. A delivery I've been expecting was rerouted through Covalex's Gundo station out near Crusader, but an accident there stopped all shipments. I tried getting a refund, but the company I ordered from says it's Covalex's fault, and Covalex says that their terms of service covers a delay like this. ~mission(Timed)I guess at this point I just want my package and I don't really care how I get it. Even to the point where I'm willing to pay the extra shipping to have someone just  take it to ~mission(Destination) for me. ~mission(Reference)
covalexrand_desc_0006=I need someone with access to a ship to fly out to Covalex's Gundo station and take a box there to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Reference)And before you get the wrong idea or anything, I'm not talking about stealing or anything, because it's my package. Covelex is just dragging their feet delivering it because of the investigation or safety or whatever excuse they're using. ~mission(Timed)
covalexrand_desc_0007=A package I ordered is stuck because of the accident that happened at Gundo. I paid good creds for this and now it's just sitting there gathering dust. Seems to me that if Covalex isn't gonna do anything about it, then I might as well pay someone to find it and take it to ~mission(Destination) for me. ~mission(Reference)~mission(Timed)
covalexrand_desc_0008=I am going crazy. Covalex keeps telling me that they delivered my package, but I didn't get it. The last routing information I have places it at their Gundo center, so I'm thinking that it got misplaced when they had the big accident there. ~mission(Reference)If you could go check it out, I bet you anything that it's just sitting there. ~mission(Timed)If it is there, I'll pay to have you bring it to ~mission(Destination).

covalexrand_reference_0003=Elaine Ward mentioned that you might be a good person to help with this. 
covalexrand_reference_0004=I heard about the investigation work you did at the station, and figured since you know the lay of the land already you'd be the perfect person to hit up. 
covalexrand_reference_0005=You've been to Gundo before, right? Makes sense that going back shouldn't be that big of an issue for you. 
covalexrand_timed_0001=This whole thing has been taking so long, it'd be great to get this wrapped up as fast as possible. 
covalexrand_timed_0002=I've pretty much run out of patience at this point. Anything you can do to get the package to me as quickly as possible would be great. 
covalexrand_timed_0003=This delivery was urgent before the delay and now it's more so. Need it delivered yesterday.

covalexspec_description_0001=Hi,\n\nI'll totally understand if you don't want to help with this, but if you can it would be amazing.\n\nSee, my boyfriend passed away during the Covalex Gundo tragedy. They said I would get all of Scott's stuff back once the investigation was complete, but as far as I know, it's been done for a while now and they still haven't given any indication of when I can get his property. It's been hard enough dealing with all this, and knowing that a package is going to show up in a month or two and rip open all these wounds, it's just too much. I would prefer to deal with it now and get it over with. If you could find a way to get his personal effects (Employee ID# 104) and drop them off at Port Olisar, I'd be very grateful.\n\nThanks for your help,\nAnya
covalexspec_description_0002=My brother was one of those people who died when that Covalex station near Crusader blew. Even worse, he was borrowing something of mine when it happened. Now some red tape asshole is trying to tell me that I have to wait to get my stuff back. Yeah right. First you kill my brother and now you want me to be patient? The nerve of these corporate jillos. Forget that. Instead, I figured I'd hire someone to go to Gundo to get my stuff and take it to Grim HEX for me. I mean, what the hell are they gonna do about it? Anyway, it's what my brother would have wanted. It's gonna be the box marked 156.\n\n- Ed
covalexspec_description_0003=Hey,\n\nSo this is a little awkward for me to talk about, but it turns out that one of the people who passed away on that Covalex station disaster, Kyomi Santos, actually bequeathed me something in her will. I was surprised to hear it, but apparantly I'm now the proud owner of everything stored in box #173. The people at Covalex say I'll be able to get it when the station opens back up but ... this is the awkward part ... I kind of really need it right now. Normally I'd just wait, but I'm trying to start my own business (I make cakes in the shape of people's homeworlds) and the credits I get from selling it will really be a huge help. I've got a little bit stashed away now that I can use to pay for someone to deliver it from Gundo to Olisar for me. I know the whole things a little bit irregular, but if there was any other way I wouldn't be asking.\n\nThanks for the help,\nThrace
covalexspec_description_0004=My son Nico was sadly among the victims of the tragic accident at Covelex's Gundo station and they still haven't returned all of his personal possessions to me. I understand that they have to do things according to regulations, but it seems unconscionable that they wouldn't make some allowances for the grieving family members. To that end, I'm seeking someone who will be able to go to the station for me. To be clear, Gundo is currently considered off limits, meaning that this would not be above board, but I feel my situation warrants special consideration. My sister says that the rate I am offering is the correct amount for retrieving the crate with Nico's belongings (#964) and bringing them to Olisar, so hopefully I can find a competent individual to settle this matter quickly.\n\nSincerely,\nGloria Theolone
covalexspec_description_0005=They said that I could find someone here to go to Gundo for me and grab a crate that belonged to my wife. If the name didn't ring a bell, that's the station where they had that big accident. My wife worked for Covalex and I know it's not really going to make losing her any easier, but I really just want Claudia's stuff back. I think about her photo collection or the necklace I gave her just sitting there in that cold dead station in some box marked 249 and it's not right. She deserves better. So how about it? You willing to go to Gundo and haul her crate back to Levski?
covalexspec_description_0006=Hi,\n\nI'm looking for someone to head to the Covalex Gundo station near Crusader and grab some items. I know this may sound like stealing, but it's my dad's stuff. You see, he was on Gundo station when it had its accident. My mom says that we need to wait until Covalex says so, but I don't think that's fair because I miss him so much. I would like something to remember him by and I don't want to wait any longer because I might start forgetting things. I'll pay you to get box 510 for me and take to Olisar so I can have it.\n\nThank you very much,\nBaylor Ward

Crus_HistMarker_From=Crusader Historical Society
Crus_HistMarker_Text_01=Famed musician Carolyn 'Vortex' Thorson was born here on January 8, 2915. Her family's ship was en route to a nearby outpost when it set down to facilitate her birth. As a teenager, Thorson earned the nickname 'Vortex' for the impressive speed and dexterity she displayed behind the drums. As a founding member of Firmament, she helped redefine popular music, making her the most famous and mimicked drummer in the UEE for over a decade.   
Crus_HistMarker_Text_02=Rayari scientists working here at the Hickes Research Outpost created a revolutionary nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) in 2938. The drug, known commonly as Ceprozin, has become widely used during cybernetic replacement surgeries, providing pain relief and curbing inflammation without any of the side effects common with other NSAIDs.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_03=Here, in 2941, Terra Mills researchers combined Cellin's unique soil composition with genetic augmentation to create a new fruit hybrid named the Terraberry. This uniquely tart, purple berry stays ripe longer than most other berries, making it ideal for interstellar shipping.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_04=Here sits the shelter that saved Bastien Nemitz. In 2930, Crusader Industries hired the noted adventurer to promote the beauty and diversity of their moons by hiking around each one and providing daily updates. Following successful journeys around Cellin and Yela, Nemitz failed to upload a daily diary from Yela on June 24th. A search party was organized but failed to find him. Days later, Nemitz contacted Crusader authorities from this shelter. He'd limped here on a shattered ankle suffering during a terrible fall that also destroyed his mobi. After he was rescued, Nemitz recovered and returned to the Talarine Divide shelter to complete his journey around Yela.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_05=This shelter was erected in part due to the generous contributions of Ethan Halton's friends and families. The large boulders and rocks that dot the Nakamura Valley have made it a popular destination for unregulated open canopy racers. Sadly, in 2917, amateur racer Ethan Halton, unable to handle the track's successive tight turns, died from injuries sustained during a racing crash. To help ensure that other racers would not share Ethan's fate, in 2918, this emergency shelter was erected.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_06=Mario Kosso was the first head of Crusader's emergency response unit. Established to provide support and rescue services to those who found themselves in need on Crusader's moons, Kosso lead the response to the team's first distress beacon, which came from this basin. It was named in his honor upon his retirement in 2938.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_07=The famous picture of Yela's ring illuminated against the darkened sky was taken here by noted photographer Juliana Aston in 2918. The vista became so connected to her artwork that in 2928 it was officially named 'Aston Ridge' in her honor.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_08=Situated above a junction of multiple canyons, Wolf Point earned its name thanks to Crusader surveyor Cally Stroble who had noted excitedly in her initial report that "Against all odds, it seems a family of wolf-like creatures somehow has found a way to settle the area. Their cries can be heard for kilometers around." However, when further investigation proved that the wolves were merely a prank by a fellow surveyor, the name stuck.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_09=This ridge was named for Crusader's former CEO August Dunlow. Many credit Dunlow's vision as instrumental into transforming Crusader Industries into the company it is today. With that in mind, Dunlow Ridge, with its expansive view of the Daymar landscape, was named in his honor.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_10=This section of Daymar became known as Eager Flats after an eccentric artist who called it home. Norman Eager gained notoriety in the 2920s for constructing a series of art installations so massive they could be seen by ships flying above the flats. Deemed 'ephemeral art' by Eager, the pieces were not meant to be permanent. Instead, they were slowly degraded and buried by the moon's constantly swirling sands.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_11=The Tamdon Plains were named in honor of Advocacy agent Crista Tamdon, who in 2912 was killed in the line of duty after being ambushed while crossing these plains in pursuit of a suspect.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_12=From 2923 to 2927, a mysterious benefactor took it upon themselves to see that this emergency shelter was stocked with jars of homemade marmalade. First reported by a stranded pilot, as word spread many other travelers would visit the shelter to try the jam for themselves. In 2927, when a reporter attempted to learn who was leaving the sweet treat, the marmalade supply stopped as mysteriously as it began. However, the tradition has been kept alive to this day by the many visitors who continue to leave preserves at the site.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_13=Crusader's former lead ship designer, Shelly Ashburn, became enamored with this location for its picturesque angle of Crusader on the horizon. She often visited the spot to channel her creative energy, earning it the nickname, Ashburn Channel, among her team. Following her retirement in 2940, the site officially adopted the title.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_14=In 2936, Crusader Industries sponsored a competition to find the best travelogue focused on one of their moons. Donnell Flanagan's account of his exciting experiences took top prize and this location, which featured heavily in his adventures, was named in his honor.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_15=Crusader CEO Kelly Caplan loved the landscape on this part of Cellin and requested that this ravine be named for her dog, Julep.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_16=Here on August 25th, 2912, Lakedra Walsh organized and won the first ground vehicle race on Yela. The track became famous among ground vehicle racing enthusiasts and subsequently the site of the first official race track on the moon.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_17=On this site in 2906, Darnell Ajay built the first permanent homestead on Daymar.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_18=On this site in 2906, Phillip Xu built the first permanent homestead on Cellin.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_19=On this site in 2907, Wilma Ivery built the first permanent homestead on Yela.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_20=Advocacy agents, alongside Hurston and Crusader Security forces, pursued Amir Tremaine after he crash-landed into this canyon on Oct. 23, 2929. The wanted fugitive used pieces of his ship to hastily construct a makeshift fortification. Thus began a dramatic, three-day standoff against law enforcement officers which garnered non-stop spectrum coverage up until the final, bloody moments when the Advocacy tried but failed, to take Tremaine alive.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_21=Here on October 2nd, 2904, Chad Fawley ended the first successful solo, circumnavigation of Cellin in a ground vehicle.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_22=In 2934, Esther Hurston was kidnapped and put into a stasis pod by outlaws looking to extract a hefty ransom from her family. The ship holding the twelve-year-old's cryo-pod hid here after its reg-tags were compromised. While one outlaw attempted to procure clean reg-tags, salvager Mac Petrosky discovered the ship. He reported its location and even hid nearby to keep an eye on the ship until authorities arrived on the scene. Petrosky was awarded a Commendation from Crusader Security upon the reunion of Esther and her family.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_23=The infamous Beringer Brothers nicknamed this the "Goodbye Geyser" after repeatedly using it to dispose of those opposed to their criminal enterprises during the early 2920s. It's believed to be the final resting place for at least 14 individuals including famed bounty hunter, Bree Kuznetsov. Attempts to recover remains from the site have proven unsuccessful.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_24=Here in 2909, famed botanist Bryan Shakir began his work cataloguing the diverse flora of Daymar. Published as "Daymar in Bloom: A Flora Field Guide to Stanton 2b," it is still considered by many to be the definitive source on the subject.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_25=Erma Triolo was born on this site in 2909, making her the first person to be born on Yela. Her parents, Albert and Nora Triolo, had traveled to the moon to participate in a race when Nora went into labor. Unable to fly to the nearest medical facilitate for the birth, Albert landed their Constellation at this location and successfully served as midwife.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_26=Prior to Crusader's purchase of the gas giant and its moons, the UEE Navy controlled this part of the system. Here, in 2904, the UEE Navy established a military installation to support and watch over the shipyards perched in Crusader's upper atmosphere. The facilities were retired and relocated in 2908.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_27=Strained relations between Hurston and their workforce in late 2927-2929 resulted in a series of riots. In response, Hurston severely limited traffic to and from the planet for nearly 15 standard months. Many workers wished to escape the dangerous situation, but few had the means. One bright spot was the Hurston Hotline, a comm channel that constantly shifted frequency. Those looking to flee the unrest, and lucky enough to know the current channel frequency, could request help leaving the planet. Specific instructions were delivered in person to volunteer pilots and had to be followed exactly. The network of labor activists responsible for the Hurston Hotline during this tumultuous time used this location to shelter fleeing workers prior to moving them out of the system.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_28=Cellin was named after the youngest sibling in the classic children's story A Gift for Baba,the moon's many dormant volcanoes embodying the character's simmering anger. This dormant volcano, named Cellin's Peak by volcanologists, is carefully watched and monitored as it is believed to have a high chance of one day becoming active. 
Crus_HistMarker_Text_29=Daymar was named after the middle brother in A Gift for Baba. Known for his tendency to get lost, the character's name was also given to this twisting canyon by early explorers. 
Crus_HistMarker_Text_30=Yela was named after the eldest sibling in A Gift for Baba, who is known for her cool and calculated demeanor. This expansive plain produced the coldest temperature recorded by the first scientific expedition to the moon, earning it the name Yela's Plain. 
Crus_HistMarker_Text_31=The study of Cellin's geysers began with an observation station constructed on this location in 2908. Geologist Randell Engler spent nearly a decade investigating these natural wonders. He was first to hypothesize that the moon's geyser played an important role in dispersing vital nutrients and minerals into the soil.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_32=During Imperator Costigan's 2944 trip to the Stanton System, he shared a meal here at Gallete Family Farms. Imperator Costigan hoped his visit would draw attention to the hardworking, independent farmers across the Empire that would benefit from the agricultural subsidies legislation being debated by the Senate at the time.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_33=In 2927, Fakih Borisov introduced a herd of large, genetically modified land crabs to Daymar. Breed to withstand the moon's dry conditions, the crabs roamed this part of Daymar for nearly a decade, but Borisov's dream of turning the moon into a rancher's paradise never came to fruition. A key component to Borisov's plan was for the crab to graze on the moon's limited natural vegetation, yet doing so imbued the animals with an off-putting odor that clung to any products derived from them.  
Crus_HistMarker_Text_34=On August 22, 2924, amateur archaeologist Sonny Pak revealed a fossil that he claimed belonged to a new sentient species that inhabited this moon. News of the discovery spread across the spectrum and excited the scientific community. However, instead of allowing scientists to examine the specimen, Sonny took the remains on a publicity tour and even sold tickets to those who wished to view them. His actions were condemned by the scientific community and, after the intervention of the UEE government, the fossil was proven to be a fake.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_35=Romantics believe that lovers who profess their affection for each other on this ledge will be together forever. This legend has its origin in the macabre tale of notorious outlaw couple Akiko 'Jackal' Bazin and Rick 'Shady' Milligan. In 2913, mere moments away from capture, the pair decided to avoid imprisonment and instead leapt to their death while holding hands.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_36=On December 31, 2940, the Stanton Knights sataball team landed here so their ship could undergo emergency repairs. While waiting, the team strategized for their championship match against the Kiel Guardians scheduled for the following day. According to team members, it was here that the Knights conceived of the now famous 'Franklin Flip' play that would propel the team to victory and the first SBPL championship in the club's history.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_37=On March 17, 2904, Meiko Norwood collapsed here while loading soil samples into her ship. She passed away later that day due to complications with an artificial heart valve, making her the first person to die on Daymar.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_38=In 2939, Crusader Security apprehended a fugitive here who was wanted in connection with a massive theft of credit chits. The money wasn't recovered during the arrest, but rumors swirled that the outlaw was in possession of digging implements. Ever since, treasure hunters have flocked here in search of the lost fortune, even though repeated scans have failed to show any sign of it. \n\nCrusader Industries discourages people from digging up the area and asks that any displaced ground be placed back where it came from to preserve the moon's natural beauty.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_39=The long lost Greg Caldwell painting "The Starman's Farewell" was discovered buried underneath a stone cairn on this site in 2908. Stolen from the Terra Museum of Contemporary Art in 2731, it remains a mystery as to how the work of art ended up here. The painting was returned to Terra.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_40=In 2945, independent miner Bruce Amodeo discovered a large serendibite gemstone near this outpost. Its sale at auction to an anonymous buyer broke records for the most credits per carat spent on a serendibite. Ever since, miners have flocked to the region in search of further serendibite deposits.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_41=Tragedy struck the Cuadrado outpost on May 15, 2941, due to a malfunctioning life support system. An excess of oxygen leaking into the outpost was sparked, resulting in an explosion that took nine lives. The catastrophe drove Crusader Industries to tighten regulations on outposts and mandate more frequent maintenance checks on all facilities.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_42=Crusader Industries commends Bountiful Harvest Hydroponics for their extraordinary response to those in need on Vega. Following the horrific Vanduul attacks on October 5, 2945, Bountiful Harvest produced and donated more emergency food supplies for the Vega relief effort than any other outpost on Crusader's moons. This outpost's extraordinary sacrifice serves as a reminder that the UEE will always stand behind those who come face-to-face with the Vanduul threat.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_43=Famed actress and noted naturist, Millicent Silverton, would often come to this remote area to camp in the wilderness. She was so fond of the site that she petitioned for its inclusion in the 2941 film "Onto the Break."
Crus_HistMarker_Text_44=The geysers here feature a unique set of small fissures, that when the pressure builds up to a specific amount, make a sound similar to moaning. It is this phenomenon that has lead to the erroneous rumors that the site is haunted.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_45=In 2932, this site hosted the infamous Slim Chance Rally. This gathering of Greycat buggy enthusiasts come together once a year in a remote location to compete in an illicit destruction derby.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_46=Crusader Industries often uses this location and its irregular terrain to field test their new ship designs' landing systems. It was here on March 25th, 2934, that the first and only landing of the failed Juno ship design occurred.

destroyprobeillegal_desc=~mission(Description)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0001=The ~mission(Client) are fed up with their ops getting busted near ~mission(Location). Turns out, there's ~mission(Probe) in the area listening in on everything we do. No wonder they keep getting busted. Take care of the problem for them and there's a nice little payday waiting. Just know that PDC Monitors like this are a pain in the ass to find and they're programmed to package up their data once they're hit, so knock 'em out quick. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0002=The area around ~mission(Location) has become a huge headache for some associates of mine since Crusader Security's listening in on anything said or done out there. The ~mission(Client) found ~mission(Probe) nearby and need someone special to go hunt down these sneaky little PDC Monitors. They're a real pain in the ass to find, but finding them's only half the problem. Once you take a shot, boom, they're programmed to shut down and upload their data back to Cru-Sec Central. You gotta blast them to bits before they finish. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0003=Interested in a little target practice? Head over to ~mission(Location) and turn Crusader Security's bloody annoying spy monitors into scrap. There's ~mission(Probe) out there and nobody's been able to find the stupid things either since they barely put out a sig while they're collecting data. Anyway, the entire situation has been particularly frustrating for the ~mission(Client), which is why they're paying for someone to search the area and eliminate the threat. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)One last thing, they're rigged to dump their data when they're shot, so kill 'em quick.
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0004=Not sure if you've heard the rumors but arrests have spiked around ~mission(Location). Crusader Security's showing up at jobs and sweeping everybody to the clink. Weren't dumb luck either. Cru-Sec was waiting for them. So, I did a little recon and discovered ~mission(Probe) surveilling the area. Plenty of people, including the ~mission(Client), want this inconvenience eliminated. ~mission(Timed)I can guarantee good creds and my eternal gratitude if you do it. Hunt down the PDC Monitors wherever they're hiding, and attack hard and fast before they get a chance to upload any data they've collected. Once they're gone, we can all get back to good, ol' fashioned criminalizing. ~mission(Danger)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0005=You been by ~mission(Location) recently? ~mission(Client) told me that Crusader Security set up ~mission(Probe) to spy on anyone passing by. I'm not against a little law and order, that's what makes the game the game, but this goes too far. Let's just say that I'm not the only one who shares this sentiment. ~mission(Client) are even paying to restore the balance. These PDC Monitors are a pain to find so you'll need to search the area. Plus, when you engage, you'll need to destroy them before they finish uploading all the dirt they've scraped up. ~mission(Danger)~mission(Timed)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0006=Crusader Security thinks they're so smart. They set up ~mission(Probe) near ~mission(Location) to gather intel on the ~mission(Client). Didn't take long before someone figured it out. So, feel like getting paid to literally blow up their stupid scheme? All you got to do is be the one to actually find where the PDC Monitors are hiding and take 'em out. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)Another thing to keep in mind, these things are wired to protect the info they're pulling, so once you shoot, you gotta destroy them all before they can dump all their data back to Crusader.

destroyprobelegal_desc=~mission(Description)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0001=We've received intel from ~mission(Informant) that local criminal elements are operating ~mission(Probe) around ~mission(Location) to eavesdrop on security forces. Crusader has given authorization to enlist private contractors to help eliminate these devices.  You'll need to carefully search the area once you arrive to identify the exact location of the ~mission(Probe). Since they passively skim information, they can be tricky to find.\n\n~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)\n\nWord of warning, outlaws tend to rig these PDC Monitors with defensive protocols to automatically back up the data when attacked, so once you start shooting, you'll need to destroy them all quickly before the transfer can finish.
destroyprobelegal_desc_0002=Crusader Security needs independent combat operators to eliminate unauthorized surveillance monitors placed around ~mission(Location). According to the initial report, ~mission(Informant) has identified ~mission(Probe) intercepting data. Locating them will be difficult since they have such low EM signatures, but they must be found and destroyed before sensitive intel is leaked. ~mission(Timed)These 'skimmers' are outfitted with data security protocols. They will begin transferring the data they've gathered when threatened, so operators will need to destroy them before the upload is allowed to complete. ~mission(Danger)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0003=We've received reports that criminal elements have installed ~mission(Probe) around ~mission(Location) to spy on Crusader Security forces. Thankfully, we've finally been given the green light to hire combat operators to attack and destroy these systems. That's where you come in. \n\nYou will need to find the PDC Monitors' location before the data illicitly gathered can be uploaded. The 'skimmers' will be in their passive data collection mode when you arrive making the search for them difficult, but know that once attacked, they will begin transmitting the contents of their drives. ~mission(Danger)~mission(Timed)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0004=Crusader Security is looking for experienced combat pilots to assist in the destruction of illegal surveillance systems that have been appearing in the sector. ~mission(Timed)These outlaw 'skimmers' have contributed to the deaths of security personnel as well as civilians by providing local criminals with intel about security movements and deployments. \n\nYou will be tasked with searching the area around ~mission(Location) where ~mission(Informant) has indicated that you'll find ~mission(Probe) in operation. They will be well hidden thanks to their minimal power output. However, once engaged, these monitors will cease being covert and begin to upload their contents. You must destroy them before they complete the transfer otherwise highly sensitive data may be lost. ~mission(Danger)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0005=Outlaw groups have been using ~mission(Probe) to spy on security forces by skimming data transmitted to and from ~mission(Location). Crusader Industries is now actively seeking combat pilots to find and destroy these unauthorized 'skimmers.' ~mission(Timed)Know that it'll be difficult to hunt for their exact location since the monitors are design to only emit the barest of signatures. \n\nYou are to travel to the area, locate and then destroy all outlaw devices before any more innocent lives are lost. These PDC Monitors are outfitted with a failsafe program that will upload all data when attacked, so you will need to act before this process can complete. ~mission(Danger)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0006=Combat pilots wanted to track and destroy unauthorized surveillance monitors. ~mission(Timed)These outlaw PDC monitors are a threat to public safety and must be eliminated. You will find ~mission(Probe) near ~mission(Location), but the exact placement remains unknown at this time. Only a careful on-site search will be able to reveal exactly where these monitors are gathering intel.

dfm_ui_AdvMissileLocking=Dumb-fire missiles need no lock and fire instantly but have no tracking capability.\nHeat-seeking missiles require the target to remain in front of the ship for an amount of time dictated by several factors including your distance from the target and their infra-red emissions. Cross-section missiles (like the type your ship is armed with) focuses its tracking on the ships size and geometry. So the further away you are from the enemy, the harder it is for the missile to track.
dfm_ui_AdvMissileLocking_Title=Missile Locking (2/2)
dfm_ui_Afterburner=Afterburner increases the output of your main thrusters at the cost of boost fuel.

dfm_ui_Boosting=To overpower your ship's maneuvering thrusters hold [~action(spaceship_movement|v_boost)]. This will increase your acceleration, but once your ship reaches its top speed the effect of Boost will be negligible.\nBoosting also helps you perform sharp turns by overpowering your maneuvering thrusters to help you achieve a tighter turn.\nYour ship can store a limited amount of the fuel which is used up while Boosting though this does replenish as gases are collected during normal flight.\nIt is important that you bear this in mind and use Boost only in the situations it will make most difference.

dfm_ui_Comstab=COMSTAB is a system which manages your ship’s inertia in turns, tightening your turning circle and keeping your nose pointed where you expect it by use of maneuvering thrusters.\nWithout COMSTAB enabled during a turn your ship would continue to drift along its previous trajectory carrying you wide of your intended destination and requiring the use of other advanced maneuvers such as decoupling and Boost to maintain a good line.\nThe downside of COMSTAB is that your ship will be slowed during turns more than others using these advanced maneuvers.\nYou can cycle the various safeties on and off by pressing [~action(spaceship_movement|v_ifcs_toggle_safeties)].
dfm_ui_Comstab_Pad=COMSTAB is a system which manages your ship’s inertia in turns, tightening your turning circle and keeping your nose pointed where you expect it by use of maneuvering thrusters.\nWithout COMSTAB enabled during a turn your ship would continue to drift along its previous trajectory carrying you wide of your intended destination and requiring the use of other advanced maneuvers such as decoupling and Boost to maintain a good line.\nThe downside of COMSTAB is that your ship will be slowed during turns more than others using these advanced maneuvers.\nYou can toggle COMSTAB by pressing [~action(spaceship_movement|v_ifcs_toggle_comstab)].
dfm_ui_Comstab_Title=Comstab
dfm_ui_Control_Frame=The control frame reticle (CFR) shows the goal attitude that your ship is trying to attain.  When torque/thruster error or other outside forces prevent the ship from attaining the goal the control frame reticle will deviate from the nose reticle.   In these circumstances you should rely on the control frame reticle to pilot the ship as the forward velocity vector will always be in that direction.  IFCS will then drive the nose reticle toward the CFR as it corrects the error.

dfm_ui_CoreDefender=Core Defender
dfm_ui_Countermeasures=When a missile is locked on your ship or an enemy is trying to achieve missile lock, you can attempt to break lock by using a countermeasure.\nTo fire a countermeasure hold [~action(spaceship_defensive|v_weapon_launch_countermeasure)].
dfm_ui_Countermeasures_Cont=\nCountermeasures are designed to disrupt specific types of missiles lock.\n~icon(Flare|22|22) The flare produces an intense burst of heat in an attempt to lure any pursuing heat-seeking missiles away from your ship. Flares burn out quickly so missiles may reacquire lock-on if you fire on too early.\n~icon(Chaff|22|22) The chaff explodes into an expanding cloud of tiny filaments designed to confuse radar systems and break the lock of missiles with an electromagnetic lock-on system.\nYou can cycle the type of countermeasure armed by pressing [~action(spaceship_defensive|v_weapon_cycle_countermeasure_fwd)].
dfm_ui_Countermeasures_Reminder=To fire a countermeasure hold [~action(spaceship_defensive|v_weapon_launch_countermeasure)].

dfm_ui_ITTS=With a target focused, your ship's targeting system will try to predict where you need to fire to hit the target with each of your weapons.\nIt does so by extending PIPs (Predicted Impact Point) from your Line of Sight reticule. Each PIP corresponds to a weapon and indicates where its projectiles will intercept given the distance and velocity of the target.\nPIPs are only predicted so if your target is far away it may alter its velocity and avoid the projectile. As a general rule, ballistic projectiles will take longer to reach a target than an energy projectile, therefore their PIPs will be projected further ahead.

distraction_desc_0001=Put down whatever you're doing and pay attention. This is a big one.\n\nThe ~mission(Client) got a massive score cooking, but in order to pull it off, they need an equally massive distraction. \n\nThat's you.\n \nYou're gonna head over to a ~mission(Location) and start nuking everything and everyone you can. ~mission(Wanted)You'll be making so much noise, no one will even care what the ~mission(Client) are up to.
distraction_desc_0002=You ever dream about flying out to some remote ~mission(Location) and shooting everything that moves? Well, guess what? I'm here to make your dreams come true. And not only that, I'm gonna pay you for it.\n\nI can't tell you all the specifics, but the upshot is that the ~mission(Client) are eager to make sure all the security in sector are kept as busy as possible.\n\nNow, it seemed to me that sending someone to rampage at the ~mission(Location) would be a damn good start. ~mission(Wanted)Shouldn't be too hard to keep everyone's attention after that.
distraction_desc_0003=The ~mission(Client) are looking to pay good credits for someone to create a distraction for them. And since I can't figure out how to lure a Vanduul fleet to the sector, a cutthroat like you flying to a ~mission(Location) and unleashing hell might be the next best thing. ~mission(Wanted)\n\nCan you believe some people choose to work in an office for a living?
distraction_desc_0004=Hey. Did you ever hear about the system-wide hunt in Ellis for that slicer a little while back? Advocacy were running in circles for days trying to take them down. Got me thinking. The ~mission(Client) are going after a huge score soon and then I thought, why not just arrange for something similar to happen here? Get all the security in the area chasing after a target so that they're blind to whatever else is going on. It would make the ~mission(Client) job a billion times easier. \n\nHere's how it'll work. You fly to a ~mission(Location) and unleash some major chaos and destruction. They already patrol places like that pretty heavily so you should have company in no time flat. ~mission(Wanted)To be honest, I'm starting to wonder if that thing in Ellis wasn't just a distraction, too.

distraction_wanted_0002=There's a caveat to this whole thing, though. With the amount of attention I want on you, your crimestat needs to stay at a level 5 minimum. It's the only way to guarantee that all eyes are on you. 
distraction_wanted_0003=Of course, an ordinary two-bit criminal won't be enough to get the whole sector engaged. No, you gonna need to rock a level 5 crimestat to create the chaos I'm after. 
distraction_wanted_0004=But the way I figure it, just showing up won't be enough. We need you to maintain a level 5 crimestat the whole time. That way we make sure every do-gooder in the sector will be racing to take you down.

Dlg_SC_mc_player_got_any_position_1801=With over 500 years of Murray Cup racing history, I can firmly say that this race was most certainly, pretty inconsequential.
Dlg_SC_mc_player_got_any_position_1802=Congratulations to the winners. Condolences to the losers. And to those in the middle... I got nothing.
Dlg_SC_mc_player_got_any_position_1803=There you have it, another mediocre race comes to a bland conclusion, and I die a little inside.
Dlg_SC_mc_player_got_any_position_1804="What an exciting finish!" is something I wish I could say. Instead I am forced to go with, "That race was certainly something that happened."
Dlg_SC_mc_player_got_any_position_1805=(Yawns). Hmm? Oh, it's finished? Someone's supposed to wake me before the end of the boring ones.
Dlg_SC_mc_player_got_any_position_1806=With results like these... there's always next year, I suppose.
Dlg_SC_mc_player_got_any_position_1807=I encourage these pilots to use today's results as an opportunity for some serious soul searching. Is racing really what I am meant to do?

Dlg_SC_mc_player_got_first_place_1604=People ask how we're ever going to make peace with the Vanduul and I say make them watch a race like that. I'll be damned if seeing flying that good doesn't make everyone just want to hug it out.
Dlg_SC_mc_player_got_first_place_1605=Done! I'm calling it! It's over! Not just this race! But all racing ever! That's how good that finish was. They didn't just win a race, they won racing itself.

Dlg_SC_mc_player_got_first_place_1607=If ever there was a time for the death threats against me to come to fruition, let it be now, 'cause racing does not get much better than that my friends.

Dlg_SC_mc_player_got_last_place_1704=And an abysmal race comes to an abysmal end, absolutely ruining all of our lives.
Dlg_SC_mc_player_got_last_place_1705=They call it a qualifier, but after watching that disappointing performance it is looking like almost none of these pilots are in fact qualified.
Dlg_SC_mc_player_got_last_place_1706=You know you love a sport when you see a race that bad and you're still willing to watch it ever again.
Dlg_SC_mc_player_got_last_place_1707=Is it over?

Dlg_SC_mc_taking_fire_1007=Shields are lighting up as some serious damage is dealt.
Dlg_SC_mc_taking_fire_1008=And a pilot getting completely edged out of this fight. They may not have the muscle for it.
Dlg_SC_mc_taking_fire_1009=Taking damage like this is not something any pilot can afford.
Dlg_SC_mc_taking_fire_1010=I can say from experience, when you're getting shot like that, the main thing running through your head is, "Please don't hit my thrusters."
Dlg_SC_mc_taking_fireTaking_Fire_01=Careful.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_barrel_roll_explanationTraining_0450_Flight_Barrel_Roll_Explanation=Rolling is a great way to orient your ship to fit through tight gaps or evade incoming fire. Now you give it a go.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_barrel_roll_introTraining_0430_Flight_Barrel_Roll_Intro=Moving on. Now this is my favorite part of training: the barrel roll.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_boost_alt_useTraining_1090_Flight_Boost_Alt_Use=You can also use it to overpower you manoeuvring thrusters in order to take tighter corners.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_boost_introTraining_1080_Flight_Boost_Explanation=If you need to get up to top speed in a hurry, try boosting.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_boost_rechargeTraining_1100_Flight_Boost_Recharge=You do have a limited amount that takes time to replenish, so don't go nuts with it.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_chaff_difficultyTraining_0800_Combat_CM_Chaff_Difficulty=Deploying chaff takes more skill than flares. To be successful, you need to put it between you and the missile.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_chaff_explanationTraining_0790_Combat_CM_Chaff_Explanation=Good. Now, a chaff creates a cloud of electromagnetic interference to mask your signature from the missile.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_chase_player_dawdles_1Training_0580_Combat_Chase_Player_Dawdles_01=What are you waiting for? Go finish it off.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_chase_player_dawdles_2Training_0580_Combat_Chase_Player_Dawdles_02=Let's go. You're on the clock, rookie.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_autoTraining_0150_Landing_Mode_Auto_Engage_Decoupled=Activating landing mode restricts you to decoupled mode, meaning only your manoeuvring thrusters fire, which is handy for precise movement in tight areas.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_manualTraining_0150_Landing_Mode_Manual_Engage_Decoupled=I've gone ahead and restricted you to decoupled mode, which makes it much easier to position yourself for a launch. In Decoupled Mode, your main engine is disengaged, allowing you to move more precisely using your manoeuvring thrusters.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_modeTraining_0820_Combat_Decoupled_Mode_Intro_01=Remember Decoupled Mode from taking off? If the Drone gets behind you, enter Decoupled mode to disengage your main engines and allow you to spin your ship around while retaining your original vector.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_player_tryTraining_0820_Combat_Decoupled_Mode_Intro_03=Give it a try, just remember to disengage it when you're done.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_reminder_autoTraining_0880_Landing_Mode_Auto_Engage_Decoupled=Remember, entering Landing Mode will automatically Decouple your ship, so don't activate it too far away from the landing pad as it cuts down your speed.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_reminder_manualTraining_0890_Landing_Mode_Manual_Engage_Decoupled=The flight system automatically cuts down on your speed when you deploy the landing gear, so don't activate it too far away from the landing pad.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_deviate_from_landingTraining_0950_Landing_Deviate_From_Landing=If you raise you landing gear or stray too far from the pad, you'll have to request it again.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_disabled_controlsTraining_0070_Cockpit_Intro_02=You'll notice the majority of your systems are disabled. I'll be controlling when they are on and offline to simulate potential scenarios in combat situations.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_doors_openTraining_0110_Take_Off_Doors_Open=Once you're aligned, the tower will open the doors.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_drone_1_introTraining_0470_Combat_Intro_03=Don't worry - it's just a training drone. It handles just like the real thing, but it's weapons are less lethal. Saying that - they still pack a punch so try not to take any hits you don't have to.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_drone_2_killedTraining_0840_Combat_Decoupled_Mode_Player_Kill_Drone=Good kill. We're heading back to the landing pad to restock and refuel for the final part of your training.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_ejects_before_warning_1Training_1410_Self-Destruct_Player_Hit_Eject_Before_Warning=I can't let you eject without initiating self-destruct.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_ejects_before_warning_2Training_1420_Self-Destruct_Player_Eject_Prompt_01=It's the only thing I can't do it remotely, kid. You have to initiate. Hurry.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_ejects_before_warning_3Training_1420_Self-Destruct_Player_Eject_Prompt_02=Your plant's leaking radiation. You need to self-destruct now.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_ejects_before_warning_4Training_1420_Self-Destruct_Player_Eject_Prompt_03=Hit self-destruct, now!

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_fire_player_dawdles_1Training_0550_Combat_Fire_Player_Dawdles_01=This kind of hesitation can get you killed. Fire.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_fire_player_doesnt_fireTraining_0540_Combat_Target_Fire_When_Ready_02=Go ahead, shoot. The drone isn't going to mind.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_flare_durationTraining_0760_Combat_CM_Flare_Duration=Flares have a short lifetime, don't be too quick to fire them.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_flare_explanationTraining_0740_Combat_CM_Flare_Explanation=Last missile was heat-seeking so equip your flares. Helpful tip, don't boost after dropping a flare. Boosted thrusters are much hotter than a flare.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_flare_launch_successTraining_0770_Combat_CM_Flare_Launch_Good=Good.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_free_lookTraining_0070_Cockpit_Intro_01=Alright. First thing's first, take a look around your cockpit and familiarise yourself with the layout. It's imperative to quickly find and access specific controls. Last thing you want to be doing in a scrap is bringing up the instructions.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_glaive_defeatedTraining_1360_Combat_Vanduul_Glaive_Defeated=Good kill. Glaive's down.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_glaive_id_short_0001=We got more hostiles inbound. Looks like there's a a recognised Ace in the mix.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_glaive_idTraining_1330_Combat_Vanduul_Id_Glaive=That Glaive's a recognised Ace, enemy designation is Tank. We're gonna have to work together to take it down.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_performance_goodTraining_1020_1st_Half_Performance_Good=You did good back there, kid. Let me guess - you're an Arena Commander fan?

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_pitch_rollTraining_0160_Take_Off_Pitch_Roll_Warning=Make sure you don't pitch or roll. It'll be tough to get back into proper alignment.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_off_centreTraining_0200_Take_Off_Player_Off-Centre=Don't align yourself with the middle of the doors. You'd be surprised how many 'cruits forget that the cockpit is not the centre of the ship.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_strafe_forwardTraining_0180_Take_Off_Player_Move_Forward=Okay. Now strafe forward onto the taxiway. If you need it, the tower should have lit up your path.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_space_brake_introTraining_1110_Flight_Space_Brake_Explanation=If you need to cut speed in a hurry, use your space brake - it's much quicker than dialing back your engines and the moment you let go of it you'll automatically accelerate back up to your previous speed.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_spire_fillerTraining_1470_Filler_And_Foreshadow_The_Spire=That, my friend, is the Spire. Isn't she a beauty?

hdactivist_assassination_danger_001=Don't take this target lightly. There's a reason Hurston's relied on them to do so much dirty work. 
hdactivist_assassination_danger_002=You're going after one vicious bastard, so best come prepared. 
hdactivist_assassination_danger_003=I'd recommend hitting them hard and fast before they have a chance to comm for backup. 
hdactivist_assassination_danger_004=Watch out for this one. 'Mercy' isn't part of their vocabulary. 
hdactivist_assassination_desc_001=To anyone who knows Hurston's recent history, they know that ~mission(TargetName) is responsible for some truly vicious crimes against the honest men and women who are trying to improve worker conditions on Hurston. Time and time again, they have acted well outside the bounds of UEE law but, of course, Hurston denies that ~mission(TargetName|Last) has anything to do with these crimes and refuses to even investigate them. This miscarriage of justice means that we must take matters into our own hands. \n\nRecently, an insider sympathetic to our cause says ~mission(TargetName|Last) can be found around ~mission(Location). I will happily pass along this information, and a substantial payday, to anyone willing to bring vengeance upon them. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger)~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_assassination_desc_002=Any chance you've heard of ~mission(TargetName)? Hurston recently promoted this bloodthirsty thug to a special task force that makes dissidents disappear. ~mission(TargetName|Last) has proven to be quite effective and even taken a perverse pleasure in the new position. It's obvious that the universe would be better off if ~mission(TargetName|Last) was taken down.\n\n~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger)I managed to get a hold of their latest deployment orders. Could be useful when tracking down the target. \n\n~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_assassination_desc_003=Let's just say the less you know about this one the better. We want you to find and eliminate a Hurston lackey named ~mission(TargetName). ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger) \n\nDetails containing their last known sighting around ~mission(Location) will be provided. ~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_assassination_timed_001=Word spreads fast around here. Don't wait too long on this, or you might lose the element of surprise. 
hdactivist_assassination_timed_002=For the sake of the movement, it's vital this gets done soon. 
hdactivist_assassination_timed_003=There's chatter that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is planning something big. You've got to stop them before it's too late.

hdactivist_basesweep_danger_002=Make sure you have more than enough ammo. There's no way to know how many of 'em will be down there. 
hdactivist_basesweep_danger_003=Make sure you're armed up and prepared for war. 
hdactivist_basesweep_danger_004=I'm not gonna lie, this will get bloody, but that's what we have to do to secure our future. 
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_001=Recently, Hurston security forces have been increasingly more violent to anyone voicing opposition to their authority. We've tried all legal channels, but it seems that an equally aggressive response will be the only way they'll hear us. I'm looking to pay someone to deliver that message.\n\nWe've learned that security forces have been operating out of ~mission(Location). I'll send you the coordinates. You go in and clear it out. ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweepDanger)\n\nHopefully there will be a day where we can resolve this through rational discourse, but they've made it clear that it is not today.\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_002=Looking for a heavy hitter interested in some serious action. ~mission(Location) is crawling with corrupt, armed assholes working for Hurston. I need them gone, pronto. Don't care how you handle it, only that it gets done. ~mission(Contractor|Danger) \n\nDo this right and you'll be compensated accordingly.\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_003=If you found this, it's probably safe to say that you have an axe to grind with Hurston. I don't know about you, but I'm sick and tired of waiting for things to magically get better. What we need are bold actions to show Hurston that the status quo must go. \n\nThat's why I dug up some info about ~mission(Location). It's where corporate thugs hang out and plan their attacks on the people of Hurston. Clearing that location would send a bold message to Corporate that we're willing to fight fire with fire. You interested? \n\nIt'll be dangerous, but you'll be paid well. ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweepDanger) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_004=We got intel on ~mission(Location) that says it's staffed with corporate thugs. We aren't just going to sit around and wait for them to crack down on our brothers and sisters who are just trying to make Hurston a better place to live. I don't have the skills to handle this type of op, but I've got the creds to fund it. Interested? \n\nShould go without saying, but this job will be highly dangerous. ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweep)A lot of good people will get hurt if someone doesn't stop them.\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_005=Looking for someone who's willing to fight for what's right. For far too long Hurston has used violence to keep its people in line. Now it's time to show them that their intimidation tactics won't go unanswered.\n\nI've recently obtained intel that's identified ~mission(Location) as being key to their security operations. Anyone willing to clear out the location will be doing the people of Hurston a great service. It'll be risky, but I'll also make sure you're paid well for your trouble. ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweep) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **

hdactivist_stealfromship_outlaw_desc_001=One of the smugglers we work with on occasion, ~mission(TargetName), refuses to complete our arranged delivery unless we triple our agreed-upon payment. As you can imagine, we can't allow their greed to endanger the movement, nor can we afford to pay their unreasonable demands. \n\nInstead, we're hopeful that you'll be able to track them down for us and forcefully retrieve our rightful property. Once you successfully bring the shipment to ~mission(Destination), we will gladly give you the credits we had originally promised ~mission(TargetName|Last). \n\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealfromship_outlaw_desc_002=Recently, one of our much needed supply runs got hit by an outlaw. Before our hauler died, they managed to confirm the identity of their attacker - ~mission(TargetName).\n\nWe need you to hunt this bastard down and take back what's ours. And of course we'll pay you for delivering the supplies to ~mission(Destination).\n\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealfromship_outlaw_desc_003=~mission(TargetName) betrayed us. \n\nAn important shipment we had smuggled in to ~mission(Destination) went missing a few days ago and we were finally able to track it down. One of our operatives, ~mission(TargetName|Last), had stolen it.\n\nWe need that traitor tacked down and the shipment brought back. Do whatever you need to.  \n\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealfromship_outlaw_desc_004=Hurston Security is taking active action to cut off our supply routes. They're even turning a blind eye to outlaws in the area as long as it's our ships being attacked. We need to respond before our resources are completely cut off. \n\nWe've been able to track down the location of one of these outlaws, ~mission(TargetName). Bring the stolen goods aboard their ship back to ~mission(Destination). I don't expect ~mission(TargetName|Last) will give it up without a fight.\n\nHopefully this'll show Hurston that we will not back down.\n\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **

hdactivist_stealitem_danger_004=As always, a gig like this can be dangerous. So plan for the worst, hope for the best, right? 
hdactivist_stealitem_danger_005=Be careful. Security could be all over that location. 
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_001=Got information on the location of a certain package that would greatly help our cause.

hdactivist_stealitem_desc_002=Want to support a good cause and earn some solid creds? \n\nIf so, then help us get our hands on specific crate that's supposed to be in ~mission(Location).

hdactivist_stealitem_desc_003=There's a growing movement focused on making Hurston a better place and we need some help. We've been tracking a certain item for some time that could help our cause in multiple ways. With Hurston's recent escalation of oppression, we believe now is the time to acquire it for ourselves, but with security forces watching our every move, we need someone else to collect it from ~mission(Location). \n\nIf you bring the crate to ~mission(Destination), we'll pay you a price commensurate with your troubles. ~mission(Contractor|Danger)~mission(Contractor|Timed)  \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_004=Recently, Hurston fabricated charges against a hauler working for us in order to confiscate a very important delivery. Their actions aren't legal, even by Hurston standards, but they don't care and we can't wait attain it through legal channels. That's why I'm looking to pay someone to do it for us.\n\nAn insider who's sympathetic to our cause claims it ended up in ~mission(Location). I'll send you the exact coordinates. ~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\nOnce you have the crate, bring it to ~mission(Destination) and I'll transfer the creds. ~mission(Contractor|Danger) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_005=The Lorville customs office claims to have lost a crate that was being sent to us by a prominent supporter outside the system. I've got it on good authority that's a lie. Those Hurston bastards simply seized it to mess with us. I can't let this injustice stand and hope you're willing to help right this wrong.\n\nI just got word that they moved the crate to ~mission(Location). I need someone to find this thing and bring it to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Contractor|Timed)~mission(Contractor|Danger)I'll make sure you're paid well for all your trouble.\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_006=I need your help. An old friend was desperate for work, so I threw him a gig hauling a valuable item for us. Turns out he had an active crime stat, and Hurston Security arrested him before he could make the delivery. Now I'm in hot water. That crate needs to get to ~mission(Destination) or I'm screwed.\n\nI pulled a few strings and discovered that the cargo actually ended up in ~mission(Location).

The Parties agree that any damages owed by Company to Independent Contractor, if any, will be met without special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages and are wholly addressable by credit damages (including the provision of Company credits redeemable with Company’s affiliates) and that specific performance, injunctions, and equitable relief thereto are disclaimed to the fullest extent of the law. \n\n9)  Specific Performance and Equitable Relief:  The Parties acknowledge that time is of the essence to the Contract and a material provision of the Contracted Task, and that money damages alone will not compensate Company for non-performance of the Contract.  \n\n10)  Guarantees and Warranty:  Company offers no warranties or guarantees with respect to any equipment, rentals, loans, gear, or other logistical or operational material needs used or employed by Independent Contractor except for those manufactured or produced by Company or one of Company’s affiliates, in which case the applicable manufacturer’s warranty and/or any attendant disclaimers will attach solely to those items.\n\n11)  Intellectual Property:   Section 6) notwithstanding, you agree that any inventions or innovations conceived, enabled, or reduced to practice by you during the course of performing the Contracted Task involving the use of any Company-provided materials are deemed “work made for hire” authored by and property of the Company to the fullest extent permissible by law.  In any jurisdiction which does not permit such arrangements, you agree to assign authorship and ownership of any such inventions or trade secrets to the company and to cooperate with the company in providing any authorizations, permissions, or endorsements necessary to effectuate legal assignment of such properties.  \n          a.  In the event of inherent joint ownership of any such inventions or innovations, Company shall have shared ownership and interest to the same degree as any other participant or contributor to the innovation.   Company is under no obligation to share any information or other intellectual property with any such joint tenants as a result.\n          b.  Independent Contractor agrees to obtain any and all necessary permits or technology licenses needed to perform the Contracted Task.\n          c.  Independent Contractor agrees that in the event of breach of the Contract for failure to perform the Contacted Task, that Company is granted legal power of access to Independent Contractor’s ship and mobiGlas logs, personal effects, black box recorders, and onboard or personal data storage in order to ascertain the degree of nonperformance and/or any circumstances that might result in either the mitigation or exacerbation of any harms to Company resultant therefrom.  \n\n12)  Force Majeure: Independent Contractor agrees and acknowledges that that some of Company’s obligations or liabilities within this Contract may be subject to operational requirements or otherwise contingent on circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the Company, and that such obligations or liabilities of Company may be discharged due to impossibility or negation or mooting of their business purposes in the sole judgment of the Company.  \n\n13)  Invoicing:   Upon completion of all requirements indicated in the Statement of Work and any relevant Amendments, Company will post, wire or otherwise deliver the compensation indicated within the Statement of Work to Independent Contractor within 30 standard business days.  If Independent Contractor or his/her/its accounts are inaccessible or unreachable for delivery of compensation during that time, compensation will be maintained in escrow by Company until such time as Independent Contractor notifies Company that it is ready to receive them, subject to any applicable statute of limitations or consignment.\n\n14)  Confidentiality – Independent Contractor agrees that all communications with Company and/or its affiliates, including any employees, officers, directors, agents, or representatives thereof, will be maintained in the strictest confidence.  Independent Contractor agrees to delete or purge any logs of communications with the foregoing at the request of Company and to certify such deletion when requested.  The parties agree that the Contacted Task as posted is not confidential, and the information within may be disclosed as needed to effectuate performance of the Contracted Tasks.  \n\n15)  Governing Law:  This Contract is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commercial Territory of the planet of Hurston, Stanton System, United Empire of Earth, with full regard to its choice of law statutes, and any controversy arising in relation or connection to this Contract will be addressed thereunder, including its applicable statutes of limitation.  You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Hurston and the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts therein.  Independent Contractor is not required to maintain a personal appearance to participate in an action brought hereunder and can attend by remote conference and/or correspondence, as appropriate under the circumstances.  In the event that applicable law explicitly requires a matter to be addressed to the Independent Arbitrator’s Guild, the Parties stipulate that the conduct of any such conflict resolution process may be conducted by remote in lieu of any relocation or change of venue from the Commercial Territory of the planet of Hurston.\n\n16)  General Terms: All material received from or on behalf of the Company pursuant to the Contract must be returned to a Company operations center in the same condition in which they were received.  Failure to do so may be considered a breach of the Contract and considered stolen or otherwise misappropriated; Company reserves all rights under law and equity to engage measures and actions necessary to retrieve any and all property, physical, material, intellectual, or otherwise.  The parties agree that the Contract as well as any associated terms herein do not constitute a contract of adhesion.  The parties agree that the Contract and any amendments thereto represent the totality of the complete agreement between Company and Independent Contractor without resort to extrinsic evidence.  This Contract is enforceable to the maximum extent permissible by law; if any part of the Contract is deemed unenforceable, that part shall be stricken and the rest of the contract shall continue in full force and effect with any remaining ambiguities interpreted in favor of Company’s intentions as best determined through the resort to extrinsic evidence if necessary.  After completion or termination of the Contract, Sections 5, 8, 9, 11, 14, and 15 remain in effect in perpetuity. Severability and whole agreement.\n\n

item_Desc_Xian_Plant=One of the most iconic images of the Xi’An Empire in the UEE is the unblossomed Centennial Bloom. The growth of this plant is so precarious, even the slightest deviation in atmosphere or nourishment can offset its blooming period. Under sustained optimal conditions, the bloom takes a hundred years to live up to its name, blossoming small bellflowers of striking white and crimson. 
item_Desc10mm_pistol_ballistic=Traditional gun powder based ammunition that fires slugs from a shell, detonated by a firing pin. The slug trails down a barrel to help guide its trajectory.
item_Desc10mm_rifle_laser=The Plasma Coil - Field Fusion tangles 2 streams of plasma energy into a dense coil before unraveling it, allowing it to shoot far distances with intense energy. Unfortunately this process creates a lot of sound for the user, even though many muffle mechanics are usually built within the chamber of weapons that use this type of plasma energy.
item_Desc12g_electric=Pulse Slug 10 is a small focused energy that molds into the shape of a small ball of energy. The projectile shocks biotics and disrupts electronics. It can be clustered or shot in single form, but the chaotic nature of how the slugs are created from the energy can cause chaotic formations in its execution, much like a bubble gun.
item_Desc20mm_Tungsten=<-=MISSING=->

item_Desc325a_HAPR_VP_RMI_S3_Q2=The Hammer Propulsion HE5.3 features a high output, fuel efficient design. Its thrust output and low fuel consumption make it ideal for long hauls though it has been reported to be somewhat of a missile magnet on occasions where owners have been subject to pirate activity.
item_Desc350r_HAPR_VP_ESI_S3_Q2=The Hammer Propulsion Twin HM4.3 is notable for the fact that it utilizes 2 high-performance TR3 thrusters in a small package. An unusual application, the original design was a joint collaboration between Hammer Propulsion and the Origin Jumpworks racing team. With the additional thrust provided by a second thruster the Twin HM4.3 is ideal for applications where speed is the goal. Speed comes at a cost, however; this configuration has a thirst for fuel that rivals much larger single thruster systems, and with all of its available space being taken up by the thruster internals not much space is left for durability reinforcement. This makes the HM4.3 ideal for most racing pilots, but less suitable for combat-oriented missions.
item_Desc5mm_rifle_ballistic=The size of a traditional 5.56mm x 45mm but built for Gauss mechanics, providing very high accuracy and extremely fast projectile speeds. The 5.56mm slug is made out of a dense tungsten and lightweight carbon mixture, to allow maximum penetration in this Armor Penetration form.
item_Desc6mm_pistol_laser=Pulse Slug 10 is a small focused energy that molds into the shape of a small ball of energy. The projectile shocks biotics and disrupts electronics. It can be clustered or shot in single form, but the chaotic nature of how the slugs are created from the energy can cause chaotic formations in its execution, much like a bubble gun.

Journal_General_ContractManagerTutorial_Content=Welcome to the new Contract Manager!\n\nWith your mobiGlas’ 2.5 network software update, you may have noticed some improvements made to the Contract Manager application. It’s now easier to search through available jobs, accept contracts, and keep all your ongoing work organized. Happy Job Hunting!\n_______________________________________\n\nKEEPING TABS\n\nThe first thing you may notice when you open the Contract Manager from the mG Homespace is that there are now four tabs located along the top of your holo-display.\n\nGeneral - This tab gathers and displays available local contracts which have been Business and Labor Administration (BLA) certified to meet UEE and local law requirements.  \nPersonal - These are offers being sent to your account specifically. Users are encouraged to be cautious accepting unsolicited contracts from unknown sources.\nAccepted - Once you accept an offer, the contract is moved to this tab so that you can quickly access important information relating to it.\nHistory - When a contract comes to end, either through successful completion or by other means, the record of it is kept here for reference.\n\nNEW CONTRACT CATEGORIES\n\nWe have introduced new Contract Categories that automatically group offers by type to make it easier to find the type of job you’re interested in. \n\nAppointments - These are typically offers used to coordinate and schedule in person meetings.\nBounty Hunter - Contracts to pursue and track down specific, possibly dangerous individuals.\nECN - Contracts received through the Emergency Communication Network system.\nDelivery - Transport-related contracts to move cargo and goods between locations.\nInvestigation - Used by insurance companies and individuals to acquire information. (This update also improves the data submission tool to allow users to submit applicable information to the client from the Accepted tab*.)\nMaintenance - Jobs that require manual labor and trade skills such as repair work or hazardous material handling. \nMercenary - Offers in which the contractor is expected to have combat training, such as escort and security work.\n\nACCEPTING CONTRACTS\n\nWith the Contract Manager, after carefully reading all the information, you can apply for and accept job offers** directly from your mobiGlas. Once you have accepted a contract, from the Accepted tab you will be able to see a detailed list of objectives, and can now also track and untrack contracts to have it sync with your StarMap app, as well as cancel contracts already in progress***.\n_______________________________________\n\n* Users may choose to submit their data to the client at any point, whether the matter has been fully investigated or not. Any complications to arise from this are the solely the responsibility of the user.\n** microTech and mobiGlas do not endorse or guarantee any contracts listed in the Contract Manager and are not responsible for any risks associated with accepting uncertified contracts. \n*** microTech and mobiGlas are not accountable for any and all repercussions related to abandoning contracts.

Journal_General_CrusaderCrimeTutorial_Content=Like many who travel to the Stanton System, you may be wondering how the laws and regulations of the four megacorps compare to the laws in the rest of the UEE. While our status as an independent planet allows us latitude to govern as we see fit, you may be surprised to learn that Crusader Industries adheres to many of the legal guidelines set forth by the Empire in order to provide a safe and secure environment for all.  \n\nHere are few tips to remember while visiting Crusader and its surrounding sectors:\n\n* While the level of crime here is typically no higher than many places in the Empire, visitors should be cautious traveling to more remote areas such as the asteroid belt around the moon Yela since outlaw attacks have been known to occur.\n\n* Even though you are in Crusader Security patrolled space, damaging another individual’s ship or interfering with public landing areas are still considered misdemeanors. Note that repeated offenses will be taken very seriously.   \n\n* Beware of contract offers that involve the disabling of comm arrays. Unsavory individuals often try to lure unsuspecting victims to do this illegal task for them under false pretenses, and many travellers have fallen for this scam. Know that TAMPERING WITH COMM ARRAYS IS AGAINST THE LAW and endangers other people’s lives. Anyone caught disabling a comm array will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\n\n* The moons of Crusader are home to many beautiful sights, and touring them is a must while visiting the area. Just be sure to avoid unmarked outposts, bring plenty of fuel and oxygen, and always locate your closest emergency shelter before setting out an expedition.\n\n* Crusader Security encourages individuals to join us in helping promote a safe environment. Whether you help track down a wanted criminal, assist in patrolling nearby sectors, or respond to ECN alerts to help ships in distress, any contributions you make to the community’s overall security will be noted in your records and may go a long way in making up for any previous minor infractions. By working together we can all make Crusader a better place to visit.

Journal_General_StarmapQuantumTutorial_Content=Now that your mobiGlas has installed to the new 2.5 network update, you are ready to use the StarMap app to travel the stars in a whole new way. For the past year, the engineers at microTech have been working with industry-leading quantum drive manufacturers to allow our award winning StarMap app to seamlessly integrate with most consumer navigation software. This means you can now set quantum travel routes directly from inside the Starmap you are ready to use the StarMap to set quantum travel routes directly.  \n\nTo get started using these new features, follow the quickstart guide below.\n\nSafe Travels!\n\nThe StarMap App Dev Team\n\n_______________________________________\n\n\nSTARMAP QUANTUM TRAVEL QUICKSTART GUIDE\n\n1. From your cockpit chair, open up the StarMap app either by accessing it through your mobiGlas or your ship’s holo-display.\n\n2. Use the StarMap’s controls to pan and zoom around the map, till you see the destination you wish to travel to. (Remember, you may have to zoom in or out to locate a particular destination.)\n\n3. Click on the destination to see a route from your current location highlighted with a green scrolling dashed line. (If the route is inaccessible by a single quantum, it will appear a red static dashed line. If this is the case, you may have to travel to an accessible location first before traveling to your ultimate destination or refill your quantum fuel tank. For any additional issues, contact your quantum drive manufacturer.) \n\n4. Once you have your route selected, you can use the button on the lower left labeled “Set As Destination” to transfer these coordinates to your quantum drive’s navigational computer. The route will now be highlighted by green scrolling arrows.\n\n5. Close the StarMap and you are now set to begin quantum travel. After spooling your quantum drive in preparation, rotate your ship so that your prow is aimed at the diamond-shaped destination marker on your AR display to calibrate the navigational computer. Once spooled and calibrated, you will be able to initiate quantum to your set location. (Remember, you will not be able to quantum travel again till your drive’s cooldown period ends.)

System login indicates that Ward attempted another stress test at 1400 SET on day of accident, but didn’t ever turn the system off. Station systems went critical without the local failsafes and an explosion was inevitable.\n \nReviewing Ward’s personnel file indicated that he’d had addiction issues in the past and had even been suspended previously for negligence. Though supervisor reviews indicated he’d cleaned up since his return, our teams found evidence that he slipped back into bad habits shortly before the accident.\n \nTo perform our due diligence, we’ve exhausted other potential causes, but this one seems to be the most likely. As I mentioned, I’m still compiling my final report, which you will have when I make my presentation to the board.\n \n \nAva Skenning\nInvestigator\nCorporate Security - Covalex\n \n<i>The information contained in this message is confidential and only intended for the recipients.

I know the initial speculation was criminal sabotage, but based on this, it looked like worker negligence. Sad as it is to say.\n \nAnyway, I’ve attached a series of files to help illustrate my points and so you don’t have to sift through three million lines of data text.\n \n**/Excerpt_1 ATTACHED/**\n \nI’ve pulled together some sample readings from the Power Distribution logs. As you can see, over the past year, the station has been suffering from sporadic power drains. Maintenance reports theorized that there was a power drain somewhere, but to me, it looks like faulty switchers. These 2920’s were notorious for power flow issues.\n \n**/Excerpt_2 ATTACHED/**\n \nSo here is the initial stress test that Darnell Ward ran the day of the incident. Everything after <i>RUNPROTOCOL stresstest_v3.dnn</i> is the test taking effect. Everything looks good, right? Then, and I haven’t figured out why yet, but a few hours later (and in the middle of the stress test) he runs this <i>all_monitor_silence.dnn</i> protocol. Maybe he was trying to bring monitoring systems offline to see if they were causing the drain. I don’t really know. Anyway, it was a stupid move, because he basically removed his only way to see that the power plant was about to go critical. \n \nI’ll keep digging and keep you apprised.\n \nDennis

I knew you’d be against talking to them, but I couldn’t risk it not happening. You have every right to be angry at me for keeping it from you, but you know how you get sometimes. Honestly, I don’t know how to handle you when you get all worked up. You’ve been that way since we were kids. Remember that incident with Mom’s Cutlass? Guess I wanted to avoid all that drama until everything was official. \n\nSee... dammit, it’s hard to admit this to you ... Freund Family Fuel is running deep in the red and I don’t see a way out. I did… I did everything I could to try and find a way out, put the house up as collateral for a loan… but nothing worked. Just dumb luck I guess. \n\nSelling to Avivar is our only option to stay flying with some creds in our pockets and a shred of dignity. I know you’d argue with all your heart against it, but you don’t know the numbers like I do. This system’s a different place since Dad started all of this. Dad never had to hire a full time turret gunner for protection. Competition’s grown so fierce that the low fuel prices can’t cover our skyrocketing costs. At least if we operate under Avivar’s banner we’ll have some support during these tough times. The business may not be in our name after this, but it’ll still be ours.\n\nI know you hate me right now, but just remember that, as your brother, I love you and only want to do what’s best for all of us.

Guess I didn’t get to the turret fast enough. Adena kept yelling at me that we’d all be dead if the ship was really under attack. \n\nBut it’s not like I was dragging my heels. I’ve just never been on a ship this size before. It’s so easy to get turned around on this thing. Almost feels like someone designed this ship specifically for people to get lost on.\n\nTy keeps telling me not to worry about it. He keeps reminding me that nobody’s first run goes smoothly. Told me yesterday that “the only way you learn is by living.” This would all be super overwhelming if he wasn’t here. Not to say it’s not nice to talk to you about these things too, but by the time the message reaches you and you have the time to respond, sometimes the moment’s passed.   \n\nHeard the Captain and his sister arguing again last night. I’m not sure if they realize how loud they are or maybe they don’t care. Had to crank up the volume on my mobi to drown them out, but then I got worried I’d miss a call to get to the turret, so I turned it back down. Still not sleeping very well. Every little bump wakes me up, then it takes forever to get back to sleep. \n\nAt least I’m making some creds and gaining some experience. Once I get paid, I’ll send a portion to Mom. Maybe now that both of us are working things will be a bit easier for her. Oh, did you ever find out how much experience deckhands need on your ship? How great would that be to work this same ship.

Fair warning, I don’t think you’ll be thrilled with the news.\n\nI know you told me to hold off on repairs for the time being, but I noticed something today that’s a little worrying. The power plant’s having power spikes under normal operations. Could be a busted regulator or something, but it’s best not to strain the system until I figure out what’s going on. Might have to do with those repairs I did to the shield genny the other day. Won’t know until I run a full diagnostic.\n\nAlso, I tweaked a few things on the turret for the kid. He wouldn’t stop complaining about how slow and unresponsive it was, so I made a few minor adjustments just to keep him quiet about it. Kid’s eager, and works his tail off, but he’s as green as they come.       \n\nOne last thing, I’ve been thinking about your last message, taking Avivar’s buyout seems like the best plan. Know your Dad wouldn’t be happy about it, but he’d understand.   \n\nOh, and tell your sister before you go through with it. She definitely won’t like it, but you owe her that much.  \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

This has been a good week for Avivar in the Stanton System. I closed that contract I was telling you about last week. Had to cut them a deal, but like you say, once they experience Avivar’s amazing service, we’ve got ‘em for good. That gives us three in the system. A few more clients like this and we’ll be turning a profit in no time. \n\nIn other good news, I’ve been able to convince a local fuel concern, Freund Family Fuel, to meet with me about a possible buyout. They’ve been around for decades and have a number of primo contracts. I’ve drafted the offer so it allows them to operate under the Avivar name as long as they maintain our standards. Considering the state of their ship and employee records, it shouldn’t be hard to get rid of them following the first performance review. It’s their contracts that we really want. Not their aging Starfarer. Will let you know when I’m closing in on a deal so you can give it final approval. \n\nI know I’ve only been here a few months, but I see a lot of potential for Avivar in Stanton and have some big plans. Just give me the time and I’ll give you this system. \n\nI’ll be in touch next week. \n\n-	Patricia    \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

I don’t have to tell you how important it is for the company that our expansion into the system succeeds. \n\nWith that in mind, I must say that I have my concerns over how Ms. Sarafian is handling the situation. One of my main problems in making an educated assessment is a lack of good information. Ms. Sarafian, despite a number of subtle and not to subtle requests, only submits her required weekly report for me to review. \n\nThat’s where I was hoping you could come in. For here forward, I need you to provide me with a day-by-day accounting of Avivar’s happenings in the system without informing Ms. Sarafian that you are doing so. I reviewed your personnel file and see that you have been an excellent Avivar employee over the years. Since you have been so good to us, you can expect Avivar to be good to you for your assistance and discretion in this matter. \n\n-	MD \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

You best watch your back, because one day you’ll turn around and see me standing there. Then you’ll have to answer for what you did to me and my family. \n \nConsider this comm a courtesy. Stop shelling out info on us to Avivar, and get out of Stanton as fast as you can. ‘Cause if we ever cross paths, it won’t end well for you.      \n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

I was just on the bridge for the last few hours, bored outta my mind, and it hit me like a lightning bolt. Had to sneak away so I could get this idea to you before I forgot it. \n\nWhat if, at the end of the party scene, we reveal the ship has a smuggler’s compartment that Hector didn’t know about. So he’s had the magical relic on board the entire time. That’s why the pirates don’t want to damage the ship and destroy what’s onboard. \n\nPlus, it gives ‘em a reason to board the ship and take him hostage instead of blowing him out of the sky. Then we can keep that scene we love where he’s locked in that cell and ...\n\nI gotta run. Cap keeps yelling for me over comm. But you get the idea, right? Roll that around in your mind for a bit, and I’ll call you the second Cap gets off my back. \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

LingFamily_Family_001=My brother, Ricki, was supposed to handle this job but unfortunately his cooler blew. He's getting it fixed, but in the meanwhile we're hoping you can step in. 
LingFamily_Family_002=My brother, Ricki, was supposed to handle this job but his power plant's been having issues. He's getting it fixed, it'd be great if you can take this one. 
LingFamily_Family_003=My brother, Ricki, was scheduled to handle this, but the quantum drive on his Lancer decided to stop working today. It's being repaired, but in the meanwhile we're hoping you can handle it. 
LingFamily_Family_004=My brother, Ricki, is down for the count today owing to his life support system being on its last breath. He's getting it fixed, but in the meanwhile we're hoping you can fill in. 
LingFamily_Family_005=Ricki got caught up on the opposite side of Stanton doing a long haul, so we need someone else to handle this job. 
LingFamily_Family_006=I originally had Ricki slated for this, but a leaky fuel line means he's not going to get back in time. Hopefully, you're available. 
LingFamily_Family_007=Fabian, my cousin, commed in sick again. Guess his suit actuator failed while he was doing a drop on Yela and he caught a cold. So we need someone to pick up the slack today. 
LingFamily_Family_008=Got a last minute comm from my cousin Fabian that he isn't feeling well again. Seems he picked up a stomach bug from a bad burrito and can't fly. Would be great if you could cover for him. 
LingFamily_Family_009=Hoping that you'll be able to fill in for my cousin Fabian. Not sure exactly what happened, but seems like his arm is on the fritz and he can't fly till he sees a cybernetician. You'll definitely be helping us out if you're available. 
LingFamily_Family_010=You ever hear of Dolphin Tongue? Well, my cousin Fabian woke up with it. Half his face is swollen to the size of burstmelon. Would you be free to take over for him today? 
LingFamily_Family_011=My cousin Maggi had some trouble with the Nine Tails and is filing a report with Crusader right now. Of course, that could wind up taking all afternoon so I need someone to handle this job for her. 
LingFamily_Family_012=I thought that my cousin Maggi was going to be able to do this one, but she has to chase down a missing order. Hoping that it wasn't stolen. Either way, she's going to be tied up for a while. 
LingFamily_Family_013=Fabian caught a stomach bug and now the rest of the family seems to have got it. To be honest, I'm not feeling so great, but I'm hanging in for now. Since they're all busy making their own "deliveries" until the medicine kicks in, I was thinking you might be able to take care of this job. 
LingFamily_Family_014=A bunch of the family headed over to New Babbage for the day to celebrate another cousin's birthday. And guess who didn't get to go? Anyway, still plenty of work around here that needs doing. 
LingFamily_Reaction_Bad_001=Rough time on that last contract, huh? It happens. Important thing is not focus on it too much, and get back out there - 
LingFamily_Reaction_Bad_002=Hard to say exactly where you went wrong on that last contract, but it wasn't pretty. Let's do better this time, Okay? 
LingFamily_Reaction_BadStreak_001=After that last contract, how many screw ups was that? You know what? I don't want to scold you like you're some kid. I'm just gonna say do better and leave it at that. 
LingFamily_Reaction_BadStreak_002=Seems like you've been having a really hard time getting through these contracts. Last few jobs we've thrown you're way haven't exactly gone as planned. We're not a big company so these setbacks really hurt our bottom line. You're just going to have to do better, okay? Having said that... 
LingFamily_Reaction_BadToGood_001=Guess you're a diamond in the rough, after all. Had a bet going with my sister Linda that you would screw up that last contract. Now I have to make her dinner, but hey, it's better than having to clean up your mess again. Anyway... 
LingFamily_Reaction_BadToGood_002=Way to turn it around. I was getting worried about you, but that last contract showed you got potential. We'll have to see if you can keep it up... 
LingFamily_Reaction_Good_001=You did good on that last contract. Nice stuff. 
LingFamily_Reaction_Good_002=Real quick, wanted to mention the last contract you did. Saw that it went well. Good work. That said...

manufacturer_DescACOM=In racing circles, the term ACOM has come to have two meanings. The first is an abbreviation of the phrase ‘a commanding lead’ – meaning to pull so far ahead that the rest of the pack doesn’t stand a chance of catching up. The second is a more recent usage in that it refers to the start-up manufacturing company who took the phrase as their epithet. ACOM focuses on creating ship components that handle as much power as possible as quickly as possible in order to give pilots the all-important extra edge during a race. Founded by the children of famed pit crew chief Garrit Bijarani, siblings Jayce and Zan took four generations of racing knowledge and gave it form in ACOM’s full line of power plants and coolers.
manufacturer_DescAEGS=Aegis grew to prominence as a manufacturer of military spacecraft during the First Tevarin War. Favored by Ivar Messer, their orbital bombers grew to public prominence after his infamous victory on Idris IV and became synonymous with the ruthless Messer regime that followed. After the Fall of the Imperator, Aegis' contracts were stripped, their ships fell out of favor with the public, and the company went into a tailspin. They downsized their craft production and turned to manufacturing parts. However, time heals all wounds and today Aegis has risen once again to be a top military contractor of ships and components.

manufacturer_DescASAS=Ascension Astro started off as a boutique specialty company; selling high-end, low IR thrusters to wealthy clients who wanted to fly their luxury ships while avoiding the eyes of greedy pirates. As good as their thrusters were at being low-sig, the effect was often ruined when the engines or shielding made by other manufacturers would be screaming the ship’s presence. Slowly, Ascension began expanding their line to include a whole suite of components that, when working in conjunction, would provide an extremely low profile and a safer journey.

Half the time these days, when you pop the hull of a spacecraft, chances are you’re going to find a J-Span. Plus, their coolers can be found in more than just ships. They have a wide variety of sizes and shapes that can be found in everything from land transports, to computer systems, to refrigerator units. Appealing to the broader consumer market, their units might not have all the bells and whistles as some of the other manufacturer’s lines, but for the most part they avoid their quirks as well.
manufacturer_DescJUST=Second only to RSI in terms of longevity in the space industry, Juno Starwerk was founded in the 24th century to build long haul freighters to support the rapid Human expansion into other star systems. Utilitarian above all us, these ships were designed to do one thing: haul as much weight as possible as cheaply as possible. While, over time, as competition increased, their share of the ship market shrank, their components had earned a reputation for dependability and ease of maintenance. Their direct sales of these components soon made up the majority of the companies income and in 2513, the ceased ship manufacture entirely to focus on supplying industrial strength components. In parts of the ’verse there are generations of mechanics who have passed knowledge and techniques for working on Juno power plants like family heirlooms. This long history also means that Juno parts and repairs are easy to come by.

manufacturer_DescYORM=Gotlieb Yorm was a top racing pilot on the professional circuit, who was known for his willingness to do anything to shave a few more seconds off his lap times. For a short while, before the Safety Commission stepped in, he would race naked, claiming clothes were an unnecessary weight. Another such innovation that was considerably more successful (and modest) was his insistence that the shields being used on his racer were too powerful. He really only needed to be able to fend off a few shots, because after that he would either have maneuvered his ship out of targeting range, or he would have lost the race anyway. Gutting apart an existing shield by hand, Yorm hacked together a lighter shield that would draw less power and only protect him just enough to escape. Soon, many other racers were trying to mimic his efforts, and when Yorm retired, he went on to successfully sell his modified shield design.

Thankfully, it appears that a ~mission(Item) has miraculously survived the incident.\n\nNow, I know that there are plenty of Hurston's rivals who would be... eager... to get an advance look at this tech. I'm sure I could convince them to pay handsomely for an opportunity like this, but I'll need you to retrieve it. You can start your search at the ~mission(Location) and work out from there. \n\nOnce recovered, you will only have a short time to upload the information from the ~mission(Item) using the decryption software on a designated Hurston server before its security protocols cause it to self-destruct. Your best bet will be to access a data center inside one of the storage facilities that dot the surface of the planet. They typically have minimal security so I don't foresee you running into any issues. \n\nOne final bit of advice - I strongly recommend bringing a multi-tool along. No knowing what state the ~mission(Location) will be in, and it's better to be prepared than sorry.\n\nNeedless to say, I will pay you handsomely upon completion and we can both bask in knowledge that Hurston has been hit where it hurts.\n\n-cd\n\n~mission(Update)
mg_clovus_bladesteal_desc_002=I managed to intercept an interesting bit of news coming over the comms. It seems Hurston's fortunes are falling quite literally; one of their satellites has crashed to the surface. Not all is lost however, for the valuable ~mission(Item) onboard appears to have survived the impact.  \n\nNow, this is one of those moments where enterprising individuals face a choice. Either do nothing, let Hurston reclaim their property and let this wretched world keep turning or seize the opportunity to capitalize. Personally, I'm leaning towards the latter and I'm hoping you feel the same. \n\nIf you were to obtain the part from the ~mission(location) before Hurston does, I'm sure I could find some parties interested in paying handsomely for a sneak peek at Hurston's hard work.\n\nOne catch (as always), is that in order to safely decrypt and extract the data, you must connect it to an official Hurston server before its security protocols cause it to self-destruct. I recommend using a storage facilities data terminal. They tend to be easier to access than anything that can be found in Lorville proper. Once the transfer is complete, I will issue your just rewards.\n\nLast piece of counsel - it would most likely behoove you to bring a multi-tool to the ~mission(Location). Extraction can sometimes prove difficult.\n\nBest of luck,\n\n-cd\n\n~mission(Update)
mg_clovus_bladesteal_desc_003=My Dear Compatriot,\n\nWonderful tidings. It seems that we have received an unexpected but most welcomed guest - a Hurston satellite has been ejected from orbit and crashed practically straight into our laps. Most importantly, the ~mission(Item) onboard has survived intact.  \n\nNow, it just so happens that this cutting-edge Prototype has been long desired by some deep-pocketed associates of mine. If you were able to acquire this wayward Blade from the ~mission(Location) before Hurston manages to do so, I could ensure significant restitution for your time and troubles.\n\nThe only real wrinkle is that the information on the Prototype is inaccessible (and will self-destruct) unless connected to an official Hurston server. Fortunately, there is access to the said server dotted around the planet inside Hurston Storage Facilities. It should be short work for you to get the Blade and then take it to the server for decryption and extraction. Once the data transfer is finished, I will happily transfer the well-earned credits into your account. \n\nI would also like to remind you to bring a multi-tool along. It would be unfortunate to go all the way to the ~mission(Location) only to be stymied by detritus.\n\nSafe travels,\n\n-cd\n\n~mission(Update)

Just an FYI, the ~mission(gang) who are putting up the creds for this are VIP, so make sure it's done right. ~mission(rush)~mission(threat)
mg_ruto_commhack_obj_long_01=Go to CommArray ~mission(CommArray).
mg_ruto_commhack_obj_long_02=Disable uplink at CommArray ~mission(CommArray).
mg_ruto_commhack_obj_short_01=Hack Site
mg_ruto_commhack_obj_short_02=Disable Uplink
mg_ruto_commhack_rush_0001=Get a move on, yeah? Need this done quick. 
mg_ruto_commhack_rush_0002=Gonna need this handled on the quick side too, if you get me. 
mg_ruto_commhack_rush_0003=Don't mess around. This has got to get done now. 
mg_ruto_commhack_rush_0004=You need to move quick on this one. 
mg_ruto_commhack_time_0001=One more thing though, you're gonna need to make sure it stays off for a while. The pros need time to work, if you get me. 
mg_ruto_commhack_time_0002=When it's done, I'm gonna need you to babysit the array. Make sure no do-gooders come and switch it back on. 
mg_ruto_commhack_time_0003=Here's the deal. Once the array's down, make sure it stays down. 
mg_ruto_commhack_time_0004=You'll need to stick around once the hack's done. I need that blackout sustained for a bit. 
mg_ruto_commhack_title=~mission(title) (~mission(CommArray))
mg_ruto_commhack_title_0001=Blackout
mg_ruto_commhack_title_0002=Dark zone

mg_ruto_commhack_title_0006=Disruption Needed
mg_ruto_commhack_title_0007=Service Interrupt
mg_ruto_confirmkill_danger_0001=You might run into a little trouble out there. I mean, that's fitting right? You are going out to find a body. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_danger_0002=And arm up. You're heading to a crime scene, you know. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_danger_0003=Keep an eye on your scans. There might be some unfriendly sorts out there. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_danger_0004=This might go without saying, you are hunting down a corpse after all, but there might be a bit of violence out on this job. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc=~mission(Desc)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0001=A bit of backstory on this one. Some random scav has been going around claiming that they offed a big time hitter by the name of ~mission(TargetName). Claims that they caught ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst) right in the middle of pulling a job. Now the thing is, if ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst) is really dead... well... that creates complications for the ~mission(Client). \n\nAnyway, after some careful negotiations from yours truly, they've coughed up some creds to pay for someone to go out and verify that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is actually dead. ~mission(Timed)You will just need to go to ~mission(Location), find the body and confirm. ~mission(Danger) 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0002=Here's a bit of dreadful business to throw your way. ~mission(Client) had a recent op that apparently turned into a total shitshow. Mayhem and carnage to the nth degree. Anyway, the rumor was that ~mission(TargetName) got clipped in the exchange, but now people are saying that the bastard's still alive. \n\nAnyway, the ~mission(Client) need to know one way or the other. That's why I'm having you go out to ~mission(Location) and confirm that they're a corpsicle. Once you get the ID, you get paid. ~mission(Danger)Pretty simple, right? ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0003=Everyone's been talking about ~mission(TargetName) recently. The ~mission(Client) have been saying that they were killed a few days ago in the middle of pulling a job for them, but... well, let's just say that they're a less than accurate source of information. Anyway, I've got a client who's eager to prove them wrong, so they're shelling out some creds to get a positive id on the body. I'll hook you up with the  ~mission(Location). You have a look and tell me if you find them. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0004=Got a simple, but kinda disgusting job here. In a recent raid, ~mission(TokenName)'s ticket got punched and I guess the ~mission(Client) want some proof of old ~mission(TokenName|NickOrFirst)'s remains for... something. I honestly don't know why. Maybe they're worried that the bastard is playing dead just to steal from them. Anyway, they gave me the  ~mission(Location) and are paying for someone to go out and confirm the kill. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0005=The ~mission(Client) hired a hitter to take out a rival who's been poaching on their turf, but between you and me, I guess they didn't really get their credits worth because the guy forgot to provide proof that ~mission(TargetName) was actually dead. Anyway, I told them I could provide that, and by that, I mean you could provide it. All you gotta do is go to  ~mission(Location) and confirm that ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst)'s touching void. ~mission(Danger)Once I get confirmation, you get paid. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_location_0001=the ship's remains

mg_ruto_confirmkill_obj_long_02a=Confirm
mg_ruto_confirmkill_obj_short_01=Wreck Site
mg_ruto_confirmkill_obj_short_02=Locate Corpse
mg_ruto_confirmkill_timed_0001=Do hurry up, will you? Body probably won't be there forever. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_timed_0002=Another thing, the clients would like to know now, so get to it. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_timed_0003=I don't really know how long bodies stick around for, so I'd recommend getting a move on. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_timed_0004=You might want to move fast. God knows what's happening to that body right now. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_title=~mission(Title)

mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0001=Odds are, anyone you come across won't be too pleased to see you. I trust you'll be able to handle them. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0002=I'm not anticipating this to be a smooth run though, so I'd make sure your guns are working. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0003=I'm not gonna lie. This one might get a little rough. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0004=Just gonna say, the last couple people I've sent on these runs have gotten tuned up, so stay sharpish. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0005=Might wanna get ready for a fight too. You never know. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc=~mission(Desc)
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0001=This one's gonna be a little tricky. The ~mission(Client) need someone to set up a ~mission(Item) so they can eavesdrop on the local suckers. You have to pick up the ~mission(Item) from ~mission(Location), set the thing up at ~mission(Destination) and get out. ~mission(Danger)Once it's up and running, you'll get your creds.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0002=Need someone to set up a snooping device for the ~mission(Client) and they're gonna pay well to make it happen. First you'll need to pick up a ~mission(Item). I think they got one set aside over at ~mission(Location). Anyway, whenever you've got one, make your way over to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Danger)You gotta set it up at the right spot or it won't work. Once the thing's running, get the hell out of there. Creds will be waiting when you're clear.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0003=~mission(Client) are paying for someone to drop a ~mission(Item) over at ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Danger)Pick up the ~mission(Item) from ~mission(Location) and get to it.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0004=You ever work with a ~mission(Item)? It's fairly simple stuff. Take it to an area, turn the thing on, and it taps into nearby comms. Nice little system if you're looking to dig up a little intel, maybe scout out a couple marks to hit. Anyway, I need one dropped at ~mission(Destination) for this thing I'm looking into and I need you to set it up. ~mission(Danger)Head over to ~mission(Location) and pick it up, they got one set aside for you. I'll transfer the credits once you got it active.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0005=I guess the ~mission(Client) are cooking up something big. They've requested a ~mission(Item) get set up over at ~mission(Destination). You'll need to grab one from ~mission(Location), head over and set it up. They're pretty self-explanatory, so don't sweat the set up. ~mission(Danger)\n\nAnyway, once you got the ~mission(Item) in place and active, get the hell out of there. I'll pay you after.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0006=Got client who's looking to put some ears on ~mission(Destination). All you gotta do is head over to ~mission(Location), pick up a ~mission(Item) then go set it up. ~mission(Danger)Job ain't over until the ~mission(Item)'s up and running, so make sure it's safe and operational. Once they get the data stream, you get the creds. Simple, right?
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(Location).
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_obj_long_02=Collect the ~mission(Item).
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_obj_long_03=Go to ~mission(Destination) to deploy ~mission(Item).

mg_ruto_distraction_analogy_001=I want you to make what the 'duul did to Vega look like a weekend on Goss. 
mg_ruto_distraction_analogy_002=I want you to make people think you're the second coming of Ivar Messar or... you know, one of the bad ones. 
mg_ruto_distraction_analogy_003=By the time you're done, I want your name to be a warning. 
mg_ruto_distraction_desc=~mission(description)
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0001=I have to say, this might be one of the best plans I've ever come up with. See, the ~mission(client) are looking to pull off the job of the century, but no way they'd get away clean. That is of course, unless there's something even bigger going down at the same time. You're gonna be the something bigger. I'm talking chaos on a whole new scale. \n\n~mission(wanted)With that nasty of a reputation, all you have to do is go visit a ~mission(Location) in the area and shoot at everything that shows up. I'll even tip off the authorities so they know exactly where you are. I figure with all the noise you'll be making, no way anyone gives two shits about what the ~mission(client) are up to.
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0002=This is the sort of job most scavers only dream about getting paid for. How often do you get paid to make as big of a mess as you can?\n\n~mission(wanted)Between the bounty on your head, and me telling everyone where to find you, you should have about every ship in the sector on your ass in seconds. I figure we'll have you make your stand at a ~mission(Location) and I'll make sure word gets out on where to find you. Then all you have to do is keep them occupied for as long as you can. \n\nOf course, you're probably wondering why you're doing all this. While I can't tell you the details, let's just say that the ~mission(client) are going to be very appreciative for you keeping all the security forces occupied.
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0003=The ~mission(client) are gonna pay you to unleash as much hell as you can in the sector. ~mission(wanted)You show up at a ~mission(Location) guns blazing, I put the word out on the spec, and just like that, everybody is looking the other way while the real job is going down. Classic misdirection.
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0004=You know how I normally want my people to keep a low profile? Well, not this time. The ~mission(client) need you to tie up every bit of law in the sector. Make them so busy they won't notice anything else going on. I'm talking next level destruction. ~mission(analogy)~mission(wanted)\n\nEven better is I'll tip off everyone before hand so they know exactly where to find you. I'm thinking a ~mission(Location) since those are usually patrolled to begin with. Then all that's left is for you to take down as many of the bastards as you can. Should make headlines on the spec for weeks.
mg_ruto_distraction_obj_long_01=Achieve a level five crimestat.
mg_ruto_distraction_obj_long_01a=Maintain a level five crimestat.
mg_ruto_distraction_obj_long_02=Go to this local ~mission(Location) and wait for security to show up.
mg_ruto_distraction_obj_long_03=Cause a scene to keep security forces distracted.

mg_ruto_distraction_title_0003=unleash the beast
mg_ruto_distraction_title_0004=all eyes on you
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_001=To make sure that they're paying attention, you're gonna have to get yourself to crimestat 5 and stay there. Only way to guarantee that every security hack and bounty hunter in the sector is gonna be making eyes at you. 
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_002=Here's the real fun part. In order to pull this off, I need you to get a level 5 crimestat. Hack a comm array, kill a bunch of people. I don't really care how. Just get to level 5 and stay there. That way there's no chance they're gonna be able to ignore a dangerous criminal such as yourself. 
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_003=Now, the reason I wanted you for this job specifically is cause of your crimestat level. Only a level 5 like yourself is a big enough threat to pull the kind of heat I'm talking about. Just do me a favor and make sure you stay at a 5 till this is all over. 
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_004=Plus, with your crimestat at a 5, you're the ideal candidate to pull this job off. Everyone within the system will be beating each other senseless to get a crack at taking you down. It's perfect. As long as you stay a level 5 that is. 
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_005=In order for this to work, you're gonna need to have a crimestat 5. That's the only way to make sure every security hack and bounty hunter in the sector is gonna be making eyes at you. Now, as it happens, I'm plugged directly into the system's ECN, so once you take the gig, I'll make you notorious.
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_006=The catch is you gotta instantly become the system's most wanted to get the kinda heat we want all focused on you. Fortunately, I got myself a backdoor into your criminal files to make that happen. All you gotta do is say yes and your crimestat goes through the roof, then you just focus on raising some hell out there.

mg_ruto_havejob_desc_0003=Hey, swing by ~mission(location). Got something for you.
mg_ruto_havejob_desc_0004=Big plans are in the works and I think you're gonna want to be a part of them. Head to Technotic and we'll discuss the nitty gritty.
mg_ruto_havejob_desc_0005=New job's in the works. If you want a slice of the credits hit me up at ~mission(location).
mg_ruto_havejob_desc_0006=Turns out I'm in need of an extra set of hands. Play your cards right, and I'm thinking it might be you. I'll tell you all about it at the shop.
mg_ruto_havejob_desc_0007=If you're looking for work, swing by the shop and I'll get you sorted.
mg_ruto_havejob_desc_0008=Have a gig that I'm thinking of bringing you in on. Could be a decent payday for everyone if it pans out. Why don't you come by ~mission(location) and we'll hash specifics.
mg_ruto_havejob_desc_0009=Things are starting to heat up. Don't want to say too much right now, but stop by the shop and I'll fill you in.
mg_ruto_havejob_desc_0010=Get your ass over to ~mission(location). I'm setting something up and I've got a little part I'd like you to play.

mg_ruto_havejob_title_0007=let's talk
mg_ruto_havejob_title_0008=got something for you
mg_ruto_intromission_desc=~mission(description)
mg_ruto_intromission_desc_0001=Hi there. I've been hearing your name pop up a lot recently on security channels. Seems you're pretty hell bent on making life difficult for those authority types. I'll be honest. I like that kind of initiative. I know some people who might be interested in subsidizing your anti-social habits. But I'm getting ahead of myself. \n\nI'd like to see how you operate in the field myself, so here's the deal, the ~mission(client) have pushed someone into the sweet hereafter and have paid for someone to make the body disappear. That's considerate, right? No sense letting trash like that stink up ~mission(location). Anyway, I'd like you to go there, collect the body and dispose of it. Don't really care where as long as it's off-world and not in front of some cops. Simple, right? Anyway, you do this and we can talk about further, more lucrative, employment opportunities. ~mission(timed)
mg_ruto_intromission_desc_0002=You're becoming quite popular among the unsavories. My name's Ruto. You've probably heard of me. Anyway, I'm a sort of talent scout for unsavories myself and I'm pretty good at it, if I say so. Part of the reason for that is standards. Not a lot of people have 'em. Me, I need to know that when I give a job to one of my people, that they'll execute it. Otherwise, it's just chaos, you know? But the bad kind. \n\nAnyway, I think we might be able to help each other out. First though, I need to see you in action for myself. The ~mission(client) ghosted some idiot down at ~mission(location) and need the body disposed of. Feels like something you could handle, no? Knock this out and maybe we can talk more. ~mission(timed)
mg_ruto_intromission_desc_0003=Why hello. Been watching you for a while now. Not in a creepy way or anything, more like professional curiosity. See, I make it my business to know who's making moves in my system. If I see someone with potential, let's just say, I bring them into the fold. \n\nAnyway, I think you might be the kinda person I should know better. But first, I've got a little job for you. Something simple to show me that you're not one of these lazy kids I see on the spectrum. That you're a real go-getter. There's a body down on ~mission(location). I won't tell you who did it or why. Only that it needs to get gone. Take it off-world somewhere and dump it. You do that and maybe I can fill you in on all the exciting opportunities available to an entrepreneurial go-getter like yourself. ~mission(timed)
mg_ruto_intromission_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(location)
mg_ruto_intromission_obj_long_02=Collect the body.
mg_ruto_intromission_obj_long_03=Get rid of the corpse off-world.

mg_ruto_intromission_timed_0001=Need to take care of this quick though. Sorry. Hate to rush, but you know, clients are paying.
mg_ruto_intromission_timed_0002=Oh, I'll need you to sort this out on the quicker side.
mg_ruto_intromission_timed_0003=One more thing, you'll need to hurry. Clients want this handled now.
mg_ruto_intromission_timed_0004=Yeah, probably should mention that I need this taken care of immediately, so off you go.

mg_ruto_invite_desc_0001=You handled yourself pretty well. I suppose it's time we meet up and make this official. Sound good? I'm working out of this old tech shop on Grim HEX called Technotic. Just come on in and find me in the back. ~mission(oldman) Anyway, swing by when you can.
mg_ruto_invite_desc_0002=Thanks for taking care of that little job for me. Hope it wasn't too messy. Anyway, as promised, I'd like to invite you down and see if we can't work out a little arrangement. If you're interested, head on over to Grim HEX. Somewhere in the back halls, you'll find a run down little hole called Technotic. I'm in the back. ~mission(oldman)
mg_ruto_invite_desc_0003=I think it's about time we talked about your future. Don't you think? You ever been to Grim HEX before? Nasty little corner of nothing in the field above Yela. Swing on by and look for a tech shop called Technotic. I'm in the back. ~mission(oldman) Anyway, we'll have a little chat about your future, yeah? See if we can help each other out.

mg_ruto_invite_oldman_002=Whatever you do. Don't piss off the guy at the front. He may not look like much, but he's an ex-Marine.
mg_ruto_invite_oldman_003=Word of warning, the guy I have guarding the counter is violent. Real violent. If you see him wearing green, run. That's his trigger color.
mg_ruto_invite_oldman_004=Make sure the guy in the front doesn't talk your ear off.

mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0001=The longer they're dark, the more credits we lose. Need them up and running ASAP. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0002=A lot of people are waiting on them to be up and running again, so basically, hurry the hell up with this. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0003=A lot of credits run through the place which makes this repair pretty damn urgent. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0004=Some other jobs I got cooking are waiting on this being taken care of and I don't like being kept waiting. Faster you get this done the better. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0005=Not to rush you or anything, but this needs to get taken care of fast.

mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0001=Normally people in our rarified profession don't mind working in the shadows, but having zero power is a bit much. It's even starting to hurt the operations down over at ~mission(Destination). See if you can go sort them out with a new battery, okay? ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0002=A storm down surface side a little while back caused some damage and now ~mission(Destination) doesn't have any power at all. Can't really afford to have them down for long, so I need you to bring them a replacement battery. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0003=Some wingnut over at ~mission(Destination) tried fixing an electrical problem on their own and now the whole outpost doesn't have power. Got to love that DIY attitude. I'm having flashbacks to ~mission(DIY). ~mission(Timed)Anyway, do me a favor and run a battery down there.
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0004=I'm hoping you have some maintenance experience, because I need someone to bring a replacement battery down to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)And if anyone's there when you show up, don't let them talk you into cleaning up or anything. The contract is just for the battery.
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0005=Got word from ~mission(Destination) that they've gone dark. Not sure what the hell they're doing there, but this is like the fifth time they've lost power this month. Probably trying to run a hot tub or something off the gennie. Either way, gonna need you to bring them a replacement battery. ~mission(Timed)

mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0001=There was an 'accident' and now there's a corpse where there shouldn't be one. ~mission(client) need a cleaner to cart the remains off-world. ~mission(timed)And don't tell me what you do with the body. It's probably better if I don't know.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0002=The ~mission(client) had a change of leadership and their former manager's been made redundant right through the eyes. Now they need someone to clear out the desk, so to speak, and dump everything off-world. ~mission(timed)Really makes me appreciate being self-employed.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0003=Bit of a going away party / funeral that I want you to attend. The guest of honor needs a ride off-world and you're gonna give it to 'em.  Dead bastard really should have known better than to skim from the ~mission(client). ~mission(timed)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0004=Guess there was a bit of a disagreement between a couple of ~mission(client) that got pretty heated. Anyway, they need someone to escort whatever's left of the losing side off the premises. ~mission(timed)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0005=One of the big truths in this 'verse is that dead bodies seldom go anywhere on their own. That's why the ~mission(client) need us to move one for them. I'm sure you can figure out somewhere suitably private to take the remains. ~mission(timed)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_obj_long_01=Go to pickup site.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_timed_0003=We need to hurry up and take care of this before before someone starts poking around. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_timed_0004=Gonna call this a rush job. Body's not going anywhere, but the ~mission(client) will feel a lot better once everything's been taken care of.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0002=Short and sweet. You're gonna head to~mission(location) and pick up a shipment of ~mission(drug). Make sure you keep a low profile and run it to ~mission(destination)". Simple. ~mission(rush)~mission(threat)One more thing. This is for the ~mission(client), so don't screw it up.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0003=Word's come down that the ~mission(client) need some product moved from ~mission(location) and delivered to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)Hopefully I don't need to reiterate this, but don't even think about sampling the supply.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0004=Apparently there's been a high demand for ~mission(drug), so the ~mission(client) need to re-up their dealers. You're gonna head down to ~mission(location), pick up the package and take it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0005=Here you go. Like I said, it's a pretty straightforward job. ~mission(client) need some ~mission(drug) grabbed from ~mission(location) and taken to ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)You do this right and not only will you stay in my good graces, you'll make some nice creds as well. Seems fair, right? ~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_rush_0001=This job comes with a timetable, so I'm gonna need you to move quick on this. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_rush_0002=Hurry up too. I'm told the masses are eager for their party favors.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_trouble_0004=Be ready for a scrap. I'm not expecting this one to go smoothly. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0001=Make sure you bring some guns. There's a high potentiality that this one might get a little rough. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0002=There's a good chance you might need to kill some people on this one. I trust you don't have a problem with that. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0003=And keep your eyes open. Word is there are predators circling, if you get my meaning. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0004=You don't mind killing people right? I'm not promising anything, but you might want to make sure you got some guns. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0005=Guy I know said that this job might've been shopped around before it landed with me, so there might be some unfriendly competition out there. Handle them. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc=~mission(desc)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0001=~mission(client) need a ~mission(item) transported from ~mission(location) and dropped at ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0002=You know how to move a box, right? This is right up your alley then. Pick up a ~mission(item) at ~mission(location) and run it over to ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)Get it done right and the ~mission(client) cut you some creds. Simple. ~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0003=We've been hired by the ~mission(client) to move some cargo. Now, they didn't tell me what's in the box and you're going to be paid not to care. All you gotta do is snag the ~mission(item) from ~mission(location) and get it to ~mission(destination) in one piece. ~mission(rush)~mission(threat) \n\nOh, do me a favor and don't look inside, okay? 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0004=As far as gigs go, they don't get much more basic than this. All you gotta do is go to ~mission(location) and snag a ~mission(item). Once you got it, take it over to ~mission(destination) and dump it. That's it. Seriously. ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0005=This is a a straight cargo run. The ~mission(item) needs to get from ~mission(location) to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)This is a job for the ~mission(client), so don't screw it up.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0006=Got a simple run for you. Well... it should be pretty simple. ~mission(client) need a ~mission(item) moved from ~mission(location) to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(threat)Get the ~mission(item) there in one piece and you get paid.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc=~mission(Desc)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0001=Here's the deal. Some people I know have some ~mission(Item) that needs disposing of. I know. I know. Not exactly the type of work you dreamed of doing, but creds are creds, right? Times like these, people should be grateful for anything that comes their way. All you gotta do is pick up the ~mission(Item) and dump it off-world. Don't care where, but maybe not in front of some cops.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0002=Kind of a basic run. Not really worth your talents, but hey, a gig's a gig, right? All you gotta do is pick up some ~mission(Item) and get rid of it. That's it.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0003=Need you to swing by one of my clients  and take away some ~mission(Item). They're paying to get it off-site and off-world, but don't care what happens after that, so neither do I. Do it and you'll get paid.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0004=Looks like a friend needs some ~mission(Item) disposed of without any questions. Head there, grab the ~mission(Item) and dump it off-world. They don't come much simpler.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0005=Hope you don't mind getting your hands dirty. I'm serious. This isn't a metaphor. There's some ~mission(Item) that needs to get dumped. Head on over and they should have it all boxed up and waiting for you to get off-world. One time contract. Standard pay.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0006=This here's a quick one. Shouldn't be too much trouble. There's some ~mission(Item) that needs to disappear. Pick it up, dump it off, get paid.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_obj_long_01=Go to pickup site.

mg_ruto_sectorsweep_danger_001=And I don't know if they've been doing some special training, or if they changed what they've been feeding the bastards, but some of these security pilots aren't half bad at fighting. Make sure you go in ready. 
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_danger_002=Now, if this was a one on one, I'd put my credits on you hands down, but since these sec-jobs tend to travel in packs, clearing them out may end up being a pretty tough fight. Not trying to scare you off, just think you should know what you're in for. 
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_danger_003=Be good to teach these corporate guns that standing up to the ~mission(client) doesn't pay. However hard they fight - and trust me, they're gonna fight - you fight back even harder. 
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_danger_004=Of course, as much as we make fun of these security hacks, don't underestimate them. Any idiot with a gun can kill you if you get sloppy. 
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc=~mission(description)
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0001=~mission(contractor) have gone ahead and started poking around somewhere they shouldn't. You're gonna make them stop. Head out to ~mission(location) and clear every last one of those advocacy-wannabes from along their patrol route. ~mission(danger)
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0002=Seems ~mission(contractor) has started patrolling out over in ~mission(location) by some of the ~mission(client)' territory. They'd normally take care of it themselves but since they've got something bigger in the works that they'd rather not risk, decided to hire an outsider to sweep the area clear. ~mission(danger)Last thing, try not to let any of them escape. It's not really professional, you know?
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0003=The ~mission(client) have a score all lined up, but they can't do anything about because some over-achieving ~mission(contractor) lugs are patrolling ~mission(location). Need you to fly along the route and take out any security you find. ~mission(danger)
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0004=I tried to warn them, but the ~mission(client) got overeager and now, thanks to them attacking too many civies, ~mission(contractor)'s stepping up patrols through ~mission(location). Gotten so bad they can't do business as long as security's there. That's where we come in. You're going to fly the patrol route and sweep it clean. ~mission(danger)Honestly though, I think you're gonna have a lot of fun with this one.
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0005=Despite the best efforts of myself and the other criminally-minded individuals in this sector, ~mission(contractor) is still trying to clean the place up. They even started patrolling out in ~mission(location). Can you believe it? There's no way we're gonna let that kind of initiative stand, so that's why you're going to fly along this patrol and clear them the hell out. ~mission(danger)

mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_danger_0002=Anyone messes with you, you drop them, yeah? 
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_danger_0003=Another thing, this'll take you in some rough parts of space. I'd recommend guns. Lots of guns. 
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_danger_0004=You know, looking at the ~mission(ship)'s position, I'm thinking you might wanna make sure your guns are all charged up. 
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_danger_0005=One of my people told me the ~mission(client) might've shopped this job around, so you may run into some trouble. 
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc=~mission(desc)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0001=A ~mission(ship) got punched out while on the drift. ~mission(client) are paying for someone to go out and pull a ~mission(item) from the wreck. ~mission(trouble)Once you get it, they want it dropped over at ~mission(destination). Sort it and you get paid. I'll send all the details about ~mission(location). ~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0002=I'll keep this simple. I need you to extract a ~mission(item) from the corpse of a ~mission(ship) and leave it at ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)The ~mission(client) passed along the location of ~mission(location). ~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0003=~mission(client) are hiring. They want someone to head out to ~mission(location) and snag a ~mission(item) from the wreck.

mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0004=This is that gig I was telling you about. Seems pretty casual, if you ask me, but I don't have to go out there. Anyway, ~mission(client) want someone to pull a ~mission(item) from a ~mission(ship) corpse and run it over to ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)That's it. ~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0005=I know how much love crawling around the wreckage of a ~mission(ship) so I saved this one just for you. And guess what, the ~mission(client) will even pay you for it. All you gotta do is snag a ~mission(item) while you're out there and take it to ~mission(destination). I'll send you the details on ~mission(location). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0006=I'm gonna include the exact job request from the ~mission(client) in its entirety just so you can see what I have to deal with:\n\nhy Ruta, my offaz an i went an downed a ~mission(ship) off in the black. bozz wanna boxes from it but didnt tell us. we three bottlz inna night and needin someone to go grab it. i sendin creds for it. \n\nI just don't know how some of these idiots stay alive as long as they do, much less fly a spaceship.

mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_timed_0004=Gonna need you to move fast on this. The ~mission(client) want it done now.

mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc=~mission(desc)
mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0001=Here's the deal, got a tip from ~mission(nickname) that some skag named ~mission(TargetName) got real ambitious and snagged a ~mission(item) from some suckers. That's all well and good, but it seems that they owe some creds to the ~mission(client) and have been refusing to use their newfound wealth to settle up. Now, the ~mission(client) want someone to ghost 'em and retrieve the ~mission(item) from the wreck. That way, they get their money back and remind any future idiots that they gotta pay their debts. ~mission(rush)Once you get the goods, drop them off at ~mission(destination) and get paid. ~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0002=How do you feel about thieving from thieves? Shouldn't matter, right? The ~mission(client) are looking to hire someone to obtain ~mission(item) from some geezer's ship.

mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0003=Here's that robbery I was telling you about. Need you to hit some poor bastard named ~mission(TargetName) who's made the massive mistake of acquiring some ~mission(item) that the ~mission(client) are looking to obtain. ~mission(trouble)Once you got it, run it over to ~mission(destination) and I'll make sure your credits are waiting. After my cut, of course. ~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0004=How're your boosting skills these days? Job's fairly simple. Track down a ship owned by ~mission(TargetName), take it out and retrieve a ~mission(item) from the wreckage. ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)Once you got it, all you gotta do is drop off the ~mission(item) over at ~mission(destination). Pay's coming down from ~mission(client), so make sure you deliver.
mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0005=~mission(client) are paying for someone to knock over ~mission(TargetName)'s ship and steal a ~mission(item). Contract's very specific that they got to go. No bargains, no mercy, just one to the dome and a trip to their cargo hold. Take the stuff to ~mission(destination) and get paid. ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0006=Friend of mine said that ~mission(nickname) was posted up in Old38 wasted out of their mind, bragging about how ~mission(TargetName) had scored a ~mission(item) that was, and I quote, 'valuable as hell.' Now, I floated this tidbit out to the sharks and the ~mission(client) were the most interested. They're willing to pay for you to head out, track down ~mission(TargetName|Last)'s ship and snatch the loot. Once you do, run it over to ~mission(destination) and drop it off. ~mission(client) will transfer the creds once they get it. ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)I think we've all learned a valuable lesson about the dangers of bragging, haven't we?

Please understand that you will have to stay on-site for the duration of your shift. Should an emergency arise before your shift is over, you just need to resign your post at the security office before leaving.

Doesn’t get much more serious than that. \n\nI’d hate to see someone so passionate about their work get put down, so I figured I’d give you some friendly advice. The way I see it, you’ve got three ways out of this. One, you run and hide in some remote corner of black till everyone forgets about all those people you killed (I got a feeling that might take a while). Two, you go to Kareah and hope that you can hack the terminal and lower your crimestat before some greedy civie sparks you. Or three, you kill everyone and everything that comes after you. Sure it’s a lot messier, but you leave a big enough trail of blood and I promise that people will think twice before looking for you.\n\nActually, with the amount of attention you’re pulling, you’re probably doing the rest of us a favor. The more people out there with a contract to hunt you down, the less eyes there are on us. Even better if you happen to kill them. Taking one for the team and all that. Tell you what, for every one of these wannabe bounty collectors you take out, I’ll see that you get a kickback.  \n\nWhatever you do, good luck out there. \n\nAnd lose my contact info for a while.\n\n-Ruto

We are sorry to inform you that after careful consideration and review, our investigation has revealed the cause of loss is not covered by the employee policy provided by Covalex Shipping.\n\nPersonal Life Policy 02107 02012000 notes the following exclusions under which benefits will not be paid if the loss:\n\n(A)	results from the Insured's alcoholism or addiction to drugs or narcotics; but not addiction which results from the administration of those substances in accordance with the advice and written instructions of a Licensed Health Care Practitioner.\n(B)	results from the Insured's participation in a felony, riot or insurrection, or involvement in an illegal occupation.\n\nThe preponderance of the evidence collected at Covalex Gundo Station and witness statements indicate that the insured was intoxicated to the point they he lost normal control of his mental and physical facilities and that this intoxication was a contributing cause of the accident.\n\nIt is against the law and considered a felony for an individual to cause the death of another by the operation of devices while under the influence of intoxicants. Even if there may be intervening factors between the fact of operation and the death of another. Felony exclusion makes no benefits payable. \n\nSince your claim was denied, you have the right to an internal appeal. You may request one by filling out a DCR-90 form. If you have questions regarding the information contained in this letter, please feel free to contact our claims department. \n\nSincerely,\n\nJessie Holzburg\n\nClaims Adjuster\nImperial General Insurance

But even if you find out he isn't, you'll still get paid. I know your time is valuable and really, I just want to know the truth.\n \nGood luck, and I hope to hear from you soon one way or another.

mobiglas_CharlieStation_Scott_Datapad_text=/**MOBICONNECT.RETRIEVALSYSTEM.FRP…DATAFOUND**/\n\nANNUAL EMPLOYEE REVIEWS - WIP \n\nRoss Biollo Notes: \n- Has developed a strong rapport with the haulers which can be good and bad. \n- Needs to make sure that professionalism isn't lost completely. \n- Two citations this year for the not properly logging crates. Needs to be more detail focused. One more strike? \n- Does a lot to help maintain crew morale. \n\nDarnell Ward Notes: \n- Was a little abrasive at first when he came back, but has settled back into a solid routine. Once in a while still have to remind him about watching his attitude. \n- Punctuality problems seemed to have gone away. Has been on time regularly for past 3 months. \n- Keeps personal space clean. \n- Can sometimes be too diligent in trying to figure out a problem. Over thinks things sometimes which means tasks can take a little longer than expected. \n- Also can lead to taking unnecessary risks. \n- Very proactive though. Will address issues without needing to be told to do so. \n\nNico Theolone Notes: \n- Very focused. \n- Gets job done. \n- Figure out how to mention deodorant thing??? \n\nKiyomi Santos Notes: \n- So far so good. Seems to be stepping into the position well. \n- Good attitude. \n- Reports could be a little cleaner. Have noticed a few typos and errors. Simple things. Should take the time to double check before filing. \n- Schedule rotation suggestion was a good one. \n- Possible candidate for advanced training \n\nMel Ososky Notes: \n- Needs to be more mindful of using mobiGlas during work hours. \n- Has helped to improve the distro rate. Moving more crates through thanks to oversight on the cargo manifests. \n- Can be territorial with responsibilities. Needs to be more willing to let others help. \n\nSelf Eval Notes: \n- Need to be better about respecting that personal hours. I have sometimes taken advantage of employees living onsite and it can blur the lines between on and off hours. Downtime is important. \n- Profits have exceeded the 3% growth mandated by Covalex, in large part to my management. \n- Employee retention has increased. Turnover rate has significantly dropped. \n- Need to be better about following up on things earlier. Don't assume employees are tracking deadlines.

mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_01_Text=LAST UPDATED: 2945-03-21_16:44SET\n\nOn 2945-03-03 we received our first report of missing BIG BENNY brand vending machines from the Port Olisar commuter hub station.  Alby Mollion, the on call manager, explained that a TERRA MILLS SERVICE TECHNICIAN had come to repair the machine and informed him that it would have to be taken to an offsite center. The following week, shift supervisor Tony Losong contacted Terra Mills Service Center to inquire about the repair only to learn that the so-called service technician had not in fact been associated with the company. It was at this point that Crusader Security was contacted by the Port Olisar administrators to look into the matter. Security vids pulled from the station’s feed captured the suspect leaving with the machine in question but so far, facial match has been a dead end. It is surmised that the suspect was wearing spoofs, faux-vis, or some combination thereof. Attempts to track the suspect’s transport also proved futile as the regtags were traced back to a decommissioned hauler. \n\nOn 2945-03-05, we received a second report from CryAstro station 1267SC where their Big Benny unit was also taken under the guise of repair.  Not long after, dozens of similar reports from other stations around the Crusader sector began to trickle in, stating that a false Terra Mills technician had removed their Big Benny machines. Those separate reports were vetted and indexed under this main casefile once the connection was confirmed. \n\nIn the meanwhile, we have been working with Terra Mills to issue a general warning to all Big Benny machine owners to be on the lookout for unscheduled service technicians and that they should always demand to see credentials. An image of the suspect has likewise been circulated. However, since 2945-03-12 there have been no further reports.\nIn attempt to track down the culprit we have notified scrap yards and secondhand sellers to alert us if someone tries to offer a Big Benny unit for sale. We have also tasked Terra Mills with tracing unusual refill orders surmising that the stolen machines may eventually require more Kacho to be stocked. \n\n**EDIT 2945-03-21 ** We did have a possible hit on the VSS we put out on the suspect’s transport, but reached a dead end after we lost the trail near Grim HEX. We currently don’t have the resources to investigate directly, but I have put in a request for a CI to follow up.\n\n

mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_AboveAndBeyond_Text=Millions of people from around the Empire come to visit Crusader every year. From stunning vistas planetside to a bevy of unique and memorable locations in the surrounding environs, there’s plenty of reasons why Crusader is considered by many to be “Above and Beyond.”\n\nWhat better way to explore the grand expanses of the Crusader than by riding aboard a Genesis Starliner that was built planetside by Crusader Industries. These luxurious cruise ships offer tours of not only the gorgeous upper atmosphere of Crusader proper, but offer a myriad of options and destinations. Why not start with a sunset tour to see a Genesis being built right before your eyes in the beautiful latticework of Crusader Industries; expansive shipyards? From there you can cruise along to the lower atmosphere to experience the colorful cacophony of one of our famous “light storms” or head out into orbit to visit the beautiful icy moon of Yela. Named for the oldest sibling in the childhood favorite fairy tale “A Gift for Baba,” a visit to this frozen landscape will surely have all the makings of a tale of your own.\n  \nFor more information on tickets and timetables, or to learn more about places to see and visit during your stay, please contact the Crusader Visitor Information Center.

mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_Artists_Subtitle=Personal Datapad - Dreams, Thoughts, and Inspiration
mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_Artists_Text=/**MOBICONNECT.RETRIEVALSYSTEM.FRP…DATAFOUND**/\n\n•	Remember, this is a free flowing expression of your thoughts. Don’t hold back. Don’t edit. Be true and you will find truth.\n\n•	Impact over substance or transformation over rehabilitation?\n\n•	The medium is part of discussion as much as the discussion itself is a medium of the art, but when that message overcomes the piece, is that the ultimate goal? Should the work stand or topple? Stop to ask ‘what if’ but make sure the remaining question is always why.\n\n•	Found another critique - “Though the work is an assault on the space, there remains little bite behind the attack. The only kindness in the experience is that the all the leftover resin has been promised to a local art school. Hopefully it may find use as art yet.” This is what I need. This pain. \n\n•	While I had some concerns at first, I am thrilled that my new hab is proving a fruitful ground for inspiration. Leaving the comfortable familiar behind and embracing the chaos of Grim HEX has been so cathartic I have begun to count losing all my credits as a blessing. \n\n•	You see these other artists who “make it.” Denara with his looms lapping up the critic’s praise, or Tamsa and her painted ships. Their embracing of the commercialization of art is the very poison that is destroying our souls. To expose how deep this commoditization of Humanity would be a true work of inspiration.\n\n•	I watched an ambush today outside the base. It was thrilling and terrifying at the same time, but it was the aftermath that struck me the most. The silence after the predators had flown away, stripping the cargo of their prey, I found myself transfixed by the drifting hulk of the wreck. The twisted shapes losing all function and becoming pure form. Definitely a motif to be explored further. \n\n•	I met a woman today who goes by the name Threetoe. She told me that if she was to die she’d want to be floated out in the asteroids by ‘the Big Sister.” She explained how her mother used to read the ‘A Gift for Baba’ to her growing up and she always related to the character. It amazes me the impact these stories of our youth can shape our very being. What replaces them as we grow older? The stories stop, but the need persists. What are the fairy tales that give us comfort now? The answer came to me as my thoughts were interrupted by cries of “So Yum, So Wow” from a nearby Big Benny’s machine. This is how the story of Humanity will be told. This corrupt consumerism will be the monument that we leave behind. \n\n•	A monument for me to leave behind …\n\n

northrock_bounty_desc_001=Got issued another bounty that we could use you on. This one's for ~mission(TargetName). I don't expect them to go down easy, but that shouldn't be a problem for you. \n\n\nSee that you get it done,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Services Group
northrock_bounty_desc_002=Your services are needed once again. This time to track and bring down the notorious ~mission(TargetName). Do me a favor and keep it as clean as you can, okay? Might be extra eyes on this one.\n\n\nThanks for handling this,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Services Group
northrock_bounty_desc_003=Have a bounty for you. ~mission(TargetName). Not the most high-profile collar, but a nasty piece of work nonetheless. Be good for everyone in the system to have this settled.\n\n\nGood luck on the hunt,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Services Group
northrock_bounty_desc_first=Hey,\n\nHope everything is going all right. I wanted to reach out and introduce myself. I'm a logistics officer for Northrock Service Group, the leading independently-owned security firm operating in the Stanton system today, providing a variety of services to all major governmental bodies as well as various private concerns. The reason I am contacting you is because we believe someone with your skills could be a boon to our clients. \n\nNot only that, but I think we'd be good fit for you. Our contractors traditionally get a higher rate of pay than a lot of our competitors in system, and a lot of them tell me how they really enjoy being tasked with the challenging and interesting work we offer. \n\nNow, Northrock holds itself to such high-standards so before we can make anything official, you'll need to achieve approved contractor status by completing a pro tem contract. I'm thinking I'll start you off collecting the bounty on ~mission(TargetName). \n\nGet that done and we'll see about getting you more work.\n\nHope to hear from you soon, \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Services Group

outlawsweep_combatpay_0002=Unfortunately, we've been unable to determine the size of the force you'll be up against, but will issue you Hazard Pay for each hostile you manage to deal with successfully. 
outlawsweep_combatpay_0003=I've also been cleared to issue Hazard Pay that scales for each outlaw you take care of. 
outlawsweep_combatpay_0004=And to preemptively answer your question, yes, in addition to the normal flat fee there will be Hazard Pay issued for each hostile you clear from the site. 
OutlawSweep_desc=~mission(Description)
outlawsweep_desc_0001=Word has just arrived that a group associated with the notorious ~mission(Client) gang has been spotted at ~mission(Location). While their intentions remain uncertain, we can all agree that it is too dangerous to allow them to carry out whatever misdeeds they are hoping to accomplish. \n\nCrusader is forming a combat response team ASAP. Grab whatever gear you'll need and head over to ~mission(Location) on the double. ~mission(CombatPay)And please, try to be safe!\n\nCONTRACT AUTHORIZED BY:\nLiaison Officer Bautista\nID# 948J030K
outlawsweep_desc_0002=Outlaws identified as members of the ~mission(Client) have been seen infilitrating a ~mission(Location). We've been after these particular bad eggs for a while now, so as you can imagine ~mission(Contractor) is pretty eager to assemble a team to deal with them. ~mission(CombatPay)\n\nIf you're interested, grab whatever gear you'll need and get going. It'd be great if we could settle this whole thing as quickly and safely as possible.\n\nCONTRACT AUTHORIZED BY:\nLiaison Officer Bautista\nID# 948J030K
outlawsweep_desc_0003=Armed members of a local criminal outfit, the ~mission(Client), were seen at ~mission(Location). We can only assume their intentions are hostile so a small team is being assembled to go and clear them out. ~mission(CombatPay) \n\nNow, since we don't want them to give us the slip, figured it would be wise to contact all operators in the area, regardless of skill or track record. If you're available — and I'm assuming you are — hurry up and grab your equipment. These ~mission(Client) are well overdue for their day of reckoning.\n\n\nCONTRACT AUTHORIZED BY:\nLiaison Officer Gibbs\nID# 91G66BW0
outlawsweep_desc_0004=Moments ago, we received a tip that several members of the ~mission(Client) outlaw organization were reported at ~mission(Location). It's vital that we stop them before they can commit any more criminal acts.\n\nTo that end, we're assembling a squad of armed and trained operators to go in and secure the site. ~mission(CombatPay)Contractors are expected to provide their own transportation and weapons. I feel like shouldn't have to say that, but you'd be surprised how many so-called 'professionals' accept a contract thinking they can borrow some from us. Next thing you'll know they'll be asking us to squeeze the trigger for them too. \n\n\nCONTRACT AUTHORIZED BY:\nLiaison Officer Gibbs\nID# 91G66BW0

outpost_repair_desc_0005=Okay, this is getting seriously frustrating. We've been trying to handle this electrical problem at ~mission(Destination) ourselves and nothing seems to fix it.

outpost_repair_timed_0002=This is a pretty urgent request as we can't work at full capacity until the problem is fixed. 
outpost_repair_timed_0003=The longer this problem goes unaddressed, the bigger of an issue it's becoming. Would be great to see this taken care of sooner than later. 
outpost_repair_timed_0004=We have a few pressing deadlines coming up, so we are looking at a pretty big headache if this isn't taken care of as soon as possible.

recoverstolen_danger_0001=We expect things should go relatively smoothly, but be ready just in case they don't. 
recoverstolen_danger_0002=We've got our hands full right now, so if things go south out there we won't be able to provide you with any back up. Go in expecting to handle any surprises on your own. 
recoverstolen_danger_0003=We did some preliminary scouting of the site and it should be clear, but experienced operators know better than to rely on that to keep them safe. 
recoverstolen_danger_0004=The thieves responsible might still be lurking around, so use caution. 
recoverstolen_desc=~mission(Description)
recoverstolen_desc_0001=We have been fortunate enough to track down a ~mission(Item) that recently was reported stolen. It is being held in ~mission(Location). We need an operator to go in, reclaim their property and return it to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)
recoverstolen_desc_0002=An informant of ours has given us word that a ~mission(Item) taken from ~mission(Destination) is being held at ~mission(Location). We are seeking a independent operator to handle the retrieval of said ~mission(Item) on our behalf and return it to its rightful owners. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger) 
recoverstolen_desc_0003=This rarely happens, but believe it or not some missing property that's been our radar just surfaced at ~mission(Location). Intact too! Now all we need is someone to give the whole thing a happy ending and return the ~mission(Item) to our clients at ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)
recoverstolen_desc_0004=After contacting us about a recent theft at ~mission(Destination), we were able to apply our tradecraft and trace their stolen ~mission(Item) to ~mission(Location). All the hard work is done, all that's left is the actually physical retrieval. Think you're up for it? ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)
recoverstolen_desc_0005=Every time you think criminals can't get any dumber, they surprise you again. These geniuses stole some~mission(item) from ~mission(Destination) but we were able to trace it right back to their ~mission(Location). Should be a simple matter for an operator to head in, retrieve the item, and return it to its proper owners.~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)Though if I'm being honest, I wouldn't be surprised if these draggers thought it was magic or something once they notice the ~mission(Item) is missing. 
recoverstolen_desc_0006=Good news. After a client of ours suffered a theft, we were able to trace their ~mission(Item) to where the criminals were holding it at ~mission(Location). We are looking for someone to finish the op, and return the property to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)

recoverstolen_space_danger_0002=Unfortunately, if things go south out there, ~mission(contractor) cannot commit combat support at this time. Take this contract at your own risk. 
recoverstolen_space_danger_0003=Use caution approaching this perp. No telling how they might react when you get them cornered. 
recoverstolen_space_danger_0004=And since this dragger is well-connected, don't be surprised if some of their ~mission(client) friends show up. 
recoverstolen_space_desc=~mission(description)
recoverstolen_space_desc_0001=An independent investigation has resulted in the location of a recently stolen ~mission(item) being tracked down. We believe it to currently be in the possession of one ~mission(TargetName), an affiliate of the ~mission(client) with a known record. ~mission(contractor) is looking for a skilled individual to track down ~mission(TargetName)'s ship, recover the lost property, and return it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(timed)~mission(danger)
recoverstolen_space_desc_0002=~mission(contractor) is seeking an experienced operator to handle the retrieval of a stolen ~mission(item) which our investagtion team has learned to be aboard the ship of known ~mission(location) affiliate; ~mission(TargetName). Once recovered, the ~mission(item) will need to be taken to its rightful owners at ~mission(destination). ~mission(timed)~mission(danger)
recoverstolen_space_desc_0003=Small miracle. Some good folks over at ~mission(destination) had a ~mission(item) stolen from them, but we've actually been able to track it down. Turns out some scag by the name of ~mission(TargetName) has the stolen ~mission(item) aboard their ship right now. However, a skilled operator should be able to hunt their ship down and return the property to where it belongs. ~mission(timed)~mission(danger)
recoverstolen_space_desc_0004=A ~mission(item) was reported stolen by one of the workers over at ~mission(destination). As a nice change of pace, we actually got a solid lead on the ~mission(client) member that pulled the job who's currently going by the handle: ~mission(TargetName). Now all we need is a suitable contractor to handle the recovery operation on our behalf. ~mission(timed)~mission(danger)Serious applicants only. EDIT: ** THIS IS NOT A GUILD JOB **
recoverstolen_space_desc_0005=We have it on good authority that a stolen ~mission(item) is currently aboard the ship of ~mission(TargetName). ~mission(contractor) needs a pilot, preferably with combat experience, to retrieve the stolen property and return it to its proper owners at ~mission(destination). ~mission(timed)~mission(danger)\n\n*This contract agreement is considered at-will, and may be terminated at any time by either party.
recoverstolen_space_desc_0006=Got a break today. After a client of ours over at ~mission(destination) got robbed, we were able to trace their stolen ~mission(item) to the ship of one ~mission(TargetName).

recoverstolen_space_timed_0002=Our intel indicates that a sale might be happening sooner than later, which means we're going to need you to move swiftly on this. 
recoverstolen_space_timed_0003=Not a lot of time to waste on this since ~mission(TargetName) is a definite flight risk. 
recoverstolen_space_timed_0004=To help limit any additional complications from springing up, we need this contract completed ASAP.

ui_LoadingScreen_Desc_BrokenMoon=Taranis was discovered in 2478 by the famed UNE survey ship Mythic Horizon. Home to a Type-A Main Sequence star and four planets, the system only had a single high-risk candidate for terraforming in its initial scouting report. Shortly after discovery, the system was the site of a tragedy: one of Mythic Horizon’s survey boats was lost with all hands in a meteor strike.\n\nAlthough the system is sparsely inhabited, intrepid miners have been known to seek their fortune among the asteroid and lunar debris fields of the Taranis system. Criminal elements have also taken to the fields as refuge or to launch attacks.
ui_LoadingScreen_Desc_Demien=Set up shortly after the UEE claimed Nexus system, Demien was one of the operations/housing/transfer stations set up for the workers attempting to terraform Nexus II. The planet was never successfully terraformed though, because the station has a much darker reputation: the site of the infamous Walzer Massacre of 2935. This incident marked the first serious clash between the UEE and the criminal element that were driven out of their system.\n\nThe incident occurred in between shifts, when members of the Horizon Crew slipped aboard the station and murdered anyone they came across. One survivor managed to make it to a comm station and alert authorities. By the time they arrived, there were only outlaws left. Local authorities were significantly outgunned and were forced to call in the Marines to retake the base. The ensuing battle lasted for six hours as Marines and Criminals fought over every centimeter of territory.
ui_LoadingScreen_Desc_DyingStar=Modeled after the Pyro system, this lawless frontier system features a dim red dwarf known as a "flare star" at its core. Six burned-out planets remain, none of which are capable of supporting life due to the violent changes in Pyro's stellar luminosity. Between super-flare events capable of melting ice on the daytime side of Pyro IV, huge sunspots cover a large portion of Pyro's star, greatly reducing its brightness. 
ui_LoadingScreen_Desc_Echo11=A former extraction facility built into the asteroid that it was burrowing into. Echo11 was built by the Hathor Group and abandoned just like they abandoned the system. Since then, it’s become a den for squatters and outlaws.\n\nRecently, it’s been used for some of the more aggressive outlaw packs to stage surgical strikes on UEE forces. The base has been launched into the public consciousness after a series of high-risk Advocacy raids attempted to take out members of Argul Dawn who had been preying on supply ships for weeks.
ui_LoadingScreen_Desc_NewHorizon=Built on the planet Green in Ellis system, New Horizon is home to the Empire's most expensive hotels and extravagant casinos and has just recently been cleared to host both Classic and Blitz races\n\nSituated in the lower atmosphere of Green in the Ellis system, New Horizon raceway features some of the most beloved tracks in Murray Cup history. From the classic Old Vanderval route through the Defford Link, racers of all levels flock to the system to hone their skills for a shot at glory in the Murray Cup.
ui_LoadingScreen_Desc_PU=Located in the Stanton system, the space around the planet Crusader has become a bustling hub of transports and tourism. Managed by Crusader Industries, visitors are invited to visit the lunar beauty of the three moons; Cellin, Yela and Daymar, or enjoy a relaxing vista aboard Port Olisar.\n\nTravelers are advised to keep a close eye on their scanners as criminal activity has unfortunately been on the rise for the past year.\n

ui_pregame_hangar_aeroview_callout3=High-tech
ui_pregame_hangar_aeroview_desc=Equally capable of holding a client meeting as well as a ship, Aeroview Hangars have become the definitive choice for the discerning executive. Built with a proprietary modular system, an Aeroview Hangar can be customized around your needs, even accommodating larger ships than most other civilian hangar providers on the market. With an overlooking office space, you won’t ever be far from your business, wherever it may take you.
ui_pregame_hangar_aeroview_history=Aeroview proudly claims to be the oldest established hangar manufacturer in Human space. Their design and construction of hangars goes back more than 300 years. In the 27th century, Arthur Nassir formed the company around a rigid code of business ethics focusing largely on design quality, a dedication to ergonomics, and an extreme respect for client confidentiality. Aeroview also famously reserves the right to refuse service to any non-Citizens. While hangar design and housing is tangential, at best, to piracy, Nassir’s outspoken contempt for those who fly outside the law led to the company’s code. When Aeroview was purchased by Shubin Interstellar, the conditions of the sale insisted that the code be adhered to in perpetuity. /n/nWhile the code remains intact, Aeroview’s original business model does not. The Aeroview hangars of the 28th century were palatial affairs built on a case-by-case basis to the specifications of the social elite capable of owning their own spacecraft. In recent years, Aeroview has adapted their tactics to follow in SELF-LAND’s footsteps (although they would never admit it). Instead of custom-building high-class hangars on an individual basis, they now produce a line of modular “business hangars” priced to sell to successful businessmen and other executive-level clients. Unlike other modular hangar companies, Aeroview does not lease the property on which their hangars are established. This is left up to the individual consumer to determine; the Aeroview hangar can be erected at any point in the UEE given 48-hours notification (24 hours, for a steep rush construction fee). Of special note, Aeroview has found particular success in developing hangars for larger scale craft or craft that require additional space for support equipment. Pilots of ships like Freelancers, with multiple crew housings, or Hornets, with weapons racks and a need for more intensive hull repair facilities, generally find it more cost effective to purchase a single Aeroview hangar rather than multiple SELF-LANDs.

ui_pregame_hangar_revelyork_desc=Excellence. Refinement. Function. These are the pillars that the architects at Revel & York hold dear when building a hangar facility. They understand that your hangar is not just a space. That it is an extension, a manifestation of its owner. Featuring handcrafted wood paneling, botanical gardens and dynamic wallscreens, Revel & York hangars will feel more like home than home.
ui_pregame_hangar_revelyork_history=When the Revel & York engineering corporation set about designing its first hangar some thirty years ago, the reaction was laughter. The company, known best for excessively expensive and visibly uncomfortable furniture, was entering a field dominated by aerospace giants. The laughter ceased quickly as the Revel & York “deluxe” line of hangars became the de-facto spacecraft garage of the rich and powerful. The company’s cavernous hangars, established on ideal landing spaces in top-dollar land agreements, earned their standing reputation for excellence and quality. /n/nRevel & York designers work directly with pilots to develop a hangar experience like no other. R&Y is the only company currently constructing modular hangars designed to support merchantman-class spacecraft like the Constellation and Caterpillar, locking them into a valuable if small segment of the population. Their hangar designs have earned their reputation: between interlocking catwalks (with motorized lifts!) to allow pilots to supervise their spacecraft from overhead, to specially designed Greycat PV buggies for transporting ship crews from module to module, everything is designed for not just the elite pilots’ usability but also their overall enjoyment. SELF-LAND and competitors make a place to put your ship; Revel & York makes a place for you to take it in.

ui_pregame_hangar_selfland_callout3=Low-tech/Colonialism 
ui_pregame_hangar_selfland_desc=Affordable and utilitarian hangars available in every system of the Empire. Self-Land prides themselves on providing a safe and secure landing experience whether you’re in Terra or Fora. Their modular design and use of prefabricated materials means that Self-Land hangars can be constructed in almost any existing structure, leading to their extensive presence around the UEE.
ui_pregame_hangar_selfland_history=Incorporated by Peter Weathermen, a wealthy guild licensed shipper who made his living on the active spacelanes, SELF-LAND hangars have become an ever-present reminder of just how easy it is for Humans to travel the stars. The corporation was founded on the philosophy that the temporary hangars available to transiting pilots were inaccessible, unaffordable and most importantly unsafe. (Weathermen began developing the company after he was jumped by a gang of dock-thugs who stripped his Starfarer to the hull plating.) /n/nStarting in the mid-29th century, SELF-LAND began a franchising-based expansion across the Human-inhabited galaxy. The first SELF-LAND was established by Weathermen on Vann in the Croshaw System. Seemingly overnight, the company had expanded to a dozen worlds … and then a hundred. Today, the SELF-LAND corporation boasts that they maintain at least one facility on every world in the UEE, with some planets (Terra chief among them) having as many as sixty different complexes. SELF-LAND hangars are fully modular and environmentally controlled. Prefabricated out of the most available common metals, they aren’t necessarily attractive to look at … but they are comfortable and familiar. The SELF-LAND experience on a colony world near Vanduul space is exactly the same as that available to a pilot berthing on Earth. The SELF-LAND corporation takes care of everything, from structure design to land titles. Because of their design, the same hangar type can be used in configurations ranging from skyscraping heights, to the breadth of a plain, to stacked underground, or to honeycombed deep within asteroids.

ui_pregame_hangar_vfgindustrial_callout3=Low-tech/Colonialism 
ui_pregame_hangar_vfgindustrial_desc=For commercial and industrial needs, why not consider a hangar from VFG Industrial? Inspired by military design principles, their effective and durable structures are capable of sustaining inhospitable conditions. With a VFG hangar, there’s no such thing as off limits.
ui_pregame_hangar_vfgindustrial_history=Tom Vivien, Walter Fink and Ulla Gandil were members of the UEE Army Corp of Engineers who specialized in quickly building pressurized landing zones in combat zones during their service. They founded VFG Industrial shortly after being discharged and attempted to bring their expertise to the civilian market. With so many mining groups and terraformers out there, they believed there was a demand for functional and well-crafted hangars in 'non-ideal' conditions. They were correct, clients came in droves, until the Army attempted to sue them for patent theft. The lawsuit claimed that VFG's entire business was built upon proprietary design briefs written for and owned by the Army. VFG tried to settle in for a long fight, but soon began to run out of resources. With a freeze on their business, no more money was coming in, but the three refused to back down./n/nWhen things seemed bleakest, they received a reprieve, of sorts. ArcCorp was very interested in their hangar building methods, specifically for their mining and terraforming subsidiaries, but also to mass-market to the public. The members of VFG were divided. Fink utterly refused to sell to the MegaCorp, but the other two knew they had no choice. The three finally agreed to sell. ArcCorp's lawyers took over their defense and within a matter of weeks managed to work some backroom black magic to hamstring the Army's case. Fink took a substantial buyout and left the firm. Tom Vivien and Ulla Gandil are technically still on the board, but control of the company has shifted to ArcCorp.

These worlds became the first privately-owned planets in the Empire. Developed quickly over the past few decades, Stanton is growing into an economic powerhouse with large amounts of trade and manufacture flocking to the commercially focused system. Of course, such rapid growth is not without problems - crime has become an increasing concern as the new corporate governments and security forces strive to maintain the law and uphold peace.

This Avenger Titan comes equipped with a specialized dogfighting focused loadout and a custom special edition livery honoring this iconic ship.
vehicle_DescAEGS_Avenger_Stalker_Titan=Manufacturer: Aegis Dynamics\nFocus: Light Freight \n\nLacking the Prisoner Cells of the Stalker or the EMP Generator of the Warlock, the Titan’s hold is free to carry cargo. Couple that available space with the Avenger’s tried and true combat abilities and you’ve got a light cargo hauler that’s more than capable of handling itself in a fight.
vehicle_DescAEGS_Avenger_Stalker_Warlock=Manufacturer: Aegis Dynamics\nFocus: Interdiction\n\nThe Avenger Warlock was built towards a single design philosophy: stop ships, don’t destroy them.

Outfitted with both manned and unmanned turrets, the Hammerhead is equally capable of providing anti-fighter support for larger capital ships or spearheading a smaller militia or security outfit.
vehicle_DescAEGS_Idris=Manufacturer: Aegis Dynamics\nFocus: Frigate\n\nA mark two 'peacekeeper' variant developed for the UEE patrol services, the Idris-P strips the standard ship's ship-to-ship gun and spinal mount in favor of additional cargo capacity and superior speed.
vehicle_DescAEGS_Idris_Test=<-=MISSING=->
vehicle_DescAEGS_Javelin=Manufacturer: Aegis Dynamics\nFocus: Destroyer\n\nDesigned for use by the UEE military, the Javelin is a massive, modular capital ship that can be appropriated for entrepreneurial use.

Dotted with turrets and missiles, the Redeemer also doubles as an armored landing craft capable of delivering armored soldiers for first person combat!
vehicle_DescAEGS_Retaliator=Manufacturer: Aegis Dynamics\nFocus: Heavy Bomber\n\nThis civilian refit of the Retaliator trades the ship's massive torpedo bays for equally massive cargo capacity.
vehicle_DescAEGS_RetaliatorBomber=Manufacturer: Aegis Dynamics\nFocus: Heavy Bomber\n\nOne of the United Empire of Earth's most powerful warbirds, Aegis Dynamics' Retaliator is a fearsome weapons platform designed to strike and kill capital ships. A key portion of the UEE's power projection, Retaliator squadrons have served with distinction against outlaws, the Vanduul, and elsewhere.
vehicle_DescAEGS_Sabre=Manufacturer: Aegis Dynamics\nFocus: Stealth Fighter\n\nPart of Aegis Dynamics’ Phase Two of new ship models, the Sabre was designed as a space superiority fighter for those situations where you need to leave a lighter footprint. Designed to be a rapid responder, the Sabre is more than capable of establishing battlefield dominance for any number of combat scenarios.
vehicle_DescAEGS_Sabre_Comet=Manufacturer: Aegis Dynamics\nFocus: Stealth Fighter\n\nCreated as part of the ‘Masters of Flight’ series in conjunction with the flight-sim Arena Commander, the Comet pays tribute to famed pilot Captain Kamur Dalion for his work with Aegis to usher in a new era of combat ship design. This Sabre comes equipped with a specialized dogfighting focused loadout and a custom special edition livery honoring this iconic ship.
vehicle_DescAEGS_Sabre_Raven=Manufacturer: Aegis Dynamics \nFocus: Interdiction\n\nAegis Dynamics have raised the bar yet again with their Raven variant, maintaining all the speed and maneuverability of its Sabre forebear, but with a lower ship signature, making it a fast, stealthy infiltrator.
vehicle_DescAEGS_Vanguard=Manufacturer: Aegis Dynamics\nFocus: Heavy Fighter\n\nA hard-charging bulldog of a fighter which features extensive forward-mounted weaponry designed to tear through the shields and armor of other spacecraft. So-named because their multiple-jump range allows them to form the vanguard of any military expedition, Vanguards have seen extensive service against the Vanduul.
vehicle_DescAEGS_Vanguard_Harbinger=Manufacturer: Aegis Dynamics\nFocus: Bomber\n\nThe Vanguard Harbinger is Earth's standard fighter/bomber, converting the standard Warden's escape pod into a potent bomb bay. The extended range of the Vanguard and the relatively small profile mean that it can go where carrier-based ships or larger strategic bombers don't, strike hard, and then make it back to base.
vehicle_DescAEGS_Vanguard_Hoplite=Manufacturer: Aegis Dynamics\nFocus: Dropship \n\nThe Vanguard Hoplite is a cross between the winning Vanguard deep space fighter and a dedicated boarding ship. Adapting the reliable design for amphibious operations, the Hoplite is the perfect tool for inserting an armored strike team with enough firepower to get them out again.
vehicle_DescAEGS_Vanguard_Sentinel=Manufacturer: Aegis Dynamics\nFocus: Interdiction \n\nThe Vanguard Sentinel is a ship that's designed to fight smart instead of taking enemies head on. The conversion features an AR cockpit, an external e-War pod, decoy missiles and a set of EMP charges. Vanguard Sentinels often provide necessary combat support for combined operations.

vehicle_DescAEGS_Vanguard_Warden=Manufacturer: Aegis Dynamics\nFocus: Heavy Fighter\n\nA hard-charging bulldog of a fighter which features extensive foward-mounted weaponry designed to tear through the shields and armor of other spacecraft.

While not outfitted for long range runs, the Hornet can take her share of hits... and dish out a consistent, powerful response.
vehicle_DescANVL_Hornet_F7CM=Manufacturer: Anvil Aerospace\nFocus: Medium Fighter\n\nThe closest to the Military load-out as is legally possible for a Civilian model, the F7C-M Super Hornet reattaches the ball turret and offers near milspec parts under the hood. Proving that two heads are better than one, a second seat has been added to split the logistic and combat duty, making the Super Hornet a truly terrifying mark to engage.
vehicle_DescANVL_Hornet_F7CR=Manufacturer: Anvil Aerospace\nFocus: Pathfinder\n\nIf the Ghost is made to hide, the Tracker is made to seek.

This Hornet comes equipped with her own personally selected loadout preferences and a custom special edition livery honoring her iconic ship.
vehicle_DescANVL_Hurricane=Manufacturer: Anvil Aerospace\nFocus: Heavy Fighter\n\nBig things do come in small packages: the Hurricane is a fighting spacecraft that packs a deadly punch into a slight fuselage. The spacecraft compensates for its lack of creature comforts with its powerful armament: six guns capable of blasting their way through nearly anything.

The Terrapin was developed near the end of the 28th century to serve as the first ship in the Empire’s defensive restructuring of the Navy. The Terrapin’s watchword is protection, with extensive shield systems and armor layers designed to provide the maximum possible defense for pilot and crew. While it lacks the maneuverability of a dedicated fighter, it does maintain an advanced, hard-hitting array of weapons intended to keep the most fearsome Vanduul raider at bay.

Vast numbers of Argo Cargos are responsible for loading and unloading goods onto massive long-haul transports and miners that cannot otherwise land on planets or drydocks, such as the Hull D and the Orion. Some captains choose to own and operate their own Argo, while others pay privately owned ships operating as port services a rental fee for performing the unloading process.

In civilian hands, Argo Personnel ships are adapted for everything from standard taxi services to use as makeshift combat dropships. The ARGO is capable of carrying up to eight humans and their equipment.
vehicle_DescBanu_Defender=Manufacturer: Banu \nFocus: Light Fighter\n\nMeet the Banu Defender, a multi-crew fighter whose patchwork design highlights technology from a variety of species. Though cargo space is limited, the Defender features modest accommodations for its crew and provides easy access to components.

vehicle_DescCNOU_Mustang_Beta=Manufacturer: Consolidated Outland \nFocus: Pathfinder\n\nThe Mustang Beta, with its unprecedented range, is made for long duration flights. The factory standard Tarsus Leaper Jump Engine enables the Beta to travel to the galaxy’s farthest systems with ease, while the ship’s unique Com4T living quarters will make the journey feel like you never left home.

vehicle_DescCNOU_Mustang_Delta=Manufacturer: Consolidated Outland \nFocus: Light Fighter\n\nWhile it may not be able to go toe to toe with some of the military specific ships, by reinforcing the Mustang’s already strong hull construction with Consolidated Outland’s own line of Cavalry Class Mass Reduction Armor, the Delta has a reduced cross-sectional signature that evens the playing field.
vehicle_DescCNOU_Mustang_Gamma=Manufacturer: Consolidated Outland \nFocus: Racing\n\nConsolidated Outland’s design and engineering teams have managed to tweak and refine the Mustang into an admirable racer. The end result, the Mustang Gamma, has smooth acceleration, and power on demand thanks to an innovative package featuring three powerful Magma Jet engines for maximum thrust.
vehicle_DescCNOU_Mustang_Omega=Manufacturer: Consolidated Outland \nFocus: Racing\n\nConsolidated Outland teamed up with custom tuning company Accelerated Mass Design to create a limited edition racer that features a ramped up fuel intake for faster recycling of the ship’s already impressive boost system.

vehicle_DescDRAK_Cutlass_Black=Manufacturer: Drake Interplanetary\nFocus: Medium Fighter / Medium Freight\n\nDrake Interplanetary claims that the Cutlass Black is a low-cost, easy-to-maintain solution for local in-system militia units.

vehicle_DescDRAK_Cutlass_DRAK_Cutlass_Blue=Manufacturer: Drake Interplanetary\nFocus: Interdiction\n\nSleek, mean, and royal. The Cutlass Blue adds missiles, a more aggressive engine, and Durasteel holding cells in the cargo bay to the standard model.

vehicle_DescMISC_Freelancer=Manufacturer: MISC\nFocus: Medium Freight\n\nFreelancers are used as long haul merchant ships by major corporations, but they are just as frequently repurposed as dedicated exploration vessels by independent captains who want to operate on the fringes of the galaxy.
vehicle_DescMISC_Freelancer_Base=Manufacturer: MISC\nFocus: Medium Freight \n\nFreelancers are used as long haul merchant ships by major corporations, but they are just as frequently re-purposed as dedicated exploration vessels by independent captains who want to operate on the fringes of the galaxy.
vehicle_DescMISC_Freelancer_DUR=Manufacturer: MISC\nFocus: Expedition \n\nThe Freelancer DUR variant specializes in exploration. Sacrificing 25% cargo capacity of the standard Freelancer for an enhanced jump drive, a more advanced scanner, and an expanded fuel tank may seem like a bad call to some, but those who value discovery over profit will find it to be their ship of choice.
vehicle_DescMISC_Freelancer_MAX=Manufacturer: MISC\nFocus: Medium Freight\n\nFreelancer variant with additional cargo capacity at the expense of weapons. The Freelancer MAX variant sacrifices weaponry for an increased cargo capacity making it ideal for equipment or raw materials transport.
vehicle_DescMISC_Freelancer_MIS=Manufacturer: MISC\nFocus: Gunship\n\nThe Freelancer MIS is a limited edition militarized variant of the classic mercantile ship developed by the UEE. These were produced in very small quantity due to some early payload incidents. This version sacrifices the majority of the cargo capacity to make way for missiles.
vehicle_DescMISC_Prospector=Manufacturer: MISC\nFocus: Mining\n\nFor years, the Prospector has been the universe’s preferred mining vessel for solo operators.

vehicle_DescMISC_Razor_EX=Manufacturer: MISC \nFocus: Stealth\n\nOutfitted with signature-reducing materials, the RAZOR-EX was a specialty build for the UEE Advocacy for use in surveillance and extraction operations. Although the EX was ultimately rejected for widespread use, MISC released a variation of the model for the public who were looking to keep a lower profile.
vehicle_DescMISC_Razor_LX=Manufacturer: MISC \nFocus: Luxury\n\nThe Razor gets supercharged. The LX features an overclocked engine to unleash blazing top speeds perfect.

vehicle_DescMISC_Reliant=Manufacturer: MISC\nFocus: Light Freight\n\nWith the Reliant Kore, MISC adds to its already impressive lineup of ships, a smaller introductory-class spacecraft. Utilizing advanced Xi’An designs, the Reliant features broad, sleek wings, omni-directional thrusters and a fully-articulated two-seat cockpit that supports horizontal and vertical flight modes. All of this combines with a larger carrying capacity than many ships in its class to make the Kore a natural choice for short-range hauling, or with the simple addition of a few optional components, this can-do ship can do anything you dream of.
vehicle_DescMISC_Starfarer=Manufacturer: MISC\nFocus: Heavy Refueling\n\nThe Starfarer differs from traditional bulk freighters in one key way: it is a dedicated fuel platform. The Starfarer is designed not only to load, store and protect fuel stasis units, it is designed to take in spaceborne hydrogen and then refine it for use without landing. The Starfarer can be used to ferry traditional bulk cargo pods (see diagram) but in such cases the fuel refining equipment would be useless. This equipment is modular and can be swapped out for another mission package for dry operations!
vehicle_DescMISC_Starfarer_Gemini=Manufacturer: MISC\nFocus: Heavy Refueling\n\nThe United Empire of Earth military uses an adapted ‘rough and tumble’ variant of the Starfarer for their front line operations. The G2M Gemini, more commonly the Starfarer Gemini or ‘Star G,’ trades some cargo capacity and maneuverability in exchange for reinforced armor, increased shielding, more powerful engines and stronger versions of the three manned turrets. The Gemini also includes an optional missile pod, which can be swapped for the fuel intake unit on the ship’s nose (see below for details.) Missile pods can be mounted to either Starfarer variant.

vehicle_DescORIG_85X=Manufacturer: Origin Jumpworks\nFocus: Touring\n\nElegantly styled and meticulously constructed, the 85X is a versatile and comprehensive away-vessel that features precision control in and out of atmosphere. Utilizing much of the same thruster technology as the 300 series, it has the power of a racer with the reliability of a touring ship. Whether descending down to the planet surface or taking in the sights of your system, this runabout continues Origin’s proud tradition of turning heads.
vehicle_DescORIG_m50=Manufacturer: Origin Jumpworks\nFocus: Racing\n\nIf you want to get from point A to point B as quickly as possible and with as much style as possible then Origin's M50 is for you.
